# Local prompt library
# By default, prompts are not tracked by git
# Commit selectively to share with team:
#   git add .meta-cc/prompts/library/release-*.md
#   git commit -m "docs: share release prompts"

# Ignore all prompts by default
*.md

# To track specific prompts, use negative patterns:
# !release-full-ci-001.md
# !debug-error-analysis-001.md
