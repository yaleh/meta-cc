# Iteration 1 Focus Recommendation
iteration_1_focus:
  selected_gap: DISC-1
  gap_name: no_learning_paths
  rationale: >
    Creating Day-1 learning path addresses the most critical pain point:
    new contributors currently spend weeks exploring the codebase manually.
    A structured Day-1 path can reduce this to hours/days, providing
    immediate high-impact value. This gap has:
    - Critical severity (affects onboarding directly)
    - High addressability (can be created systematically)
    - High expected improvement (ΔV ≈ 0.15)
    - Foundation for subsequent gaps (week-1, month-1 paths follow)

  secondary_gaps_addressed:
    - REL-2: no_time_based_paths (Day-1 is first of three time-based paths)
    - REL-1: no_role_based_docs (Day-1 path for contributor role)

  expected_outcomes:
    - V_discoverability: 0.40 → 0.50 (+0.10)
    - V_relevance: 0.20 → 0.32 (+0.12)
    - V_instance: 0.34 → 0.40 (+0.06)

  agent_needs_assessment:
    likely_need_specialized_agent: true
    candidate_agent: learning-path-designer
    rationale: >
      Systematic learning path design requires pedagogical expertise:
      - Understanding learning theory (progressive disclosure, scaffolding)
      - Defining clear learning objectives per stage
      - Sequencing concepts for optimal comprehension
      - Creating validation checkpoints
      Generic doc-writer lacks this specialized knowledge.
