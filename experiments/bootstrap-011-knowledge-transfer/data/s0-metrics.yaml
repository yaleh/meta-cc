# Iteration 0 Baseline Metrics - Knowledge Transfer System
# Bootstrap-011: Knowledge Transfer Methodology
# Date: 2025-10-17

iteration: 0

status: baseline_established

# Instance Value Function Components (Knowledge Transfer Quality)
instance_metrics:
  V_discoverability:
    value: 0.40
    components:
      search_success_rate: 0.50  # grep/find manual search possible
      navigation_ease: 0.30       # no code map, no guided navigation
      tool_availability: 0.40     # basic tools only (grep, find)
    rationale: "Manual search possible but inefficient. No structured navigation or discovery tools."

  V_completeness:
    value: 0.40
    components:
      concept_coverage: 0.70      # core concepts documented (parser, analyzer, query, MCP)
      code_coverage: 0.40         # some architecture docs, but no code maps
      expert_coverage: 0.10       # no contributor guide, no expertise map
    rationale: "Good concept documentation, weak code navigation, minimal expert knowledge capture."

  V_relevance:
    value: 0.20
    components:
      role_matching: 0.20         # no role-specific paths (contributor/user/maintainer)
      time_matching: 0.20         # no time-based paths (day-1/week-1/month-1)
      context_matching: 0.20      # no context-aware recommendations
    rationale: "One-size-fits-all documentation. No personalization or context awareness."

  V_freshness:
    value: 0.30
    components:
      tracked_freshness: 0.30     # no last-updated dates
      update_automation: 0.40     # ad-hoc updates with code changes
      staleness_detection: 0.20   # no automated staleness checks
    rationale: "Actually fresh (0 stale docs), but no tracking/automation system."

  # Calculated Total
  V_instance:
    value: 0.34
    calculation: "0.3×0.40 + 0.3×0.40 + 0.2×0.20 + 0.2×0.30"

# Identified Gaps (prioritized by severity × addressability)
gaps:
  critical:
    - gap: no_learning_paths
      description: "No guided day-1, week-1, month-1 onboarding paths"
      impact: "New contributors spend weeks exploring instead of days"
      addressability: high
      affects: [discoverability, relevance]

    - gap: no_code_navigation
      description: "No code map, module explorer, or architecture guide"
      impact: "Developers get lost in codebase structure"
      addressability: high
      affects: [discoverability, completeness]

    - gap: no_expert_map
      description: "No contributor guide or code ownership chart"
      impact: "Don't know who to ask about what"
      addressability: medium
      affects: [completeness]

  high:
    - gap: no_doc_code_links
      description: "No bidirectional links between docs and code"
      impact: "Hard to find relevant docs for code sections"
      addressability: medium
      affects: [discoverability]

    - gap: no_context_recommendations
      description: "No context-aware doc suggestions based on current task"
      impact: "Information overload or insufficient information"
      addressability: low
      affects: [relevance]

    - gap: no_freshness_tracking
      description: "No automated staleness detection or update reminders"
      impact: "Risk of outdated docs (currently fresh but no system)"
      addressability: medium
      affects: [freshness]

# Baseline Observations
observations:
  strengths:
    - comprehensive_documentation: "56 files, 35K lines covering core concepts"
    - actually_fresh: "0 stale files - docs are current"
    - clear_entry_points: "README, CLAUDE.md, docs/plan.md well-accessed"

  weaknesses:
    - unguided_discovery: "No structured learning paths or navigation"
    - missing_role_awareness: "One-size-fits-all, not tailored to contributor/user/maintainer roles"
    - missing_time_awareness: "No progression paths (day-1 → week-1 → month-1)"
    - missing_context_awareness: "No personalized recommendations"
    - single_contributor: "Bus factor of 1, knowledge concentration risk"

  opportunities:
    - learning_path_design: "Create progressive onboarding (day-1, week-1, month-1)"
    - code_navigation_tools: "Build architecture map, module explorer"
    - expert_identification: "Map code ownership via git blame"
    - doc_code_linking: "Automated bidirectional references"
    - recommendation_system: "Context-aware doc suggestions"
    - freshness_automation: "Automated staleness detection and alerts"

# Next Steps (Iteration 1 Planning)
next_iteration_focus:
  primary_objective: "Design Day-1 learning path for new contributors"
  rationale: "Biggest impact on onboarding experience (weeks → days)"
  expected_delta_v: 0.08
  agents_likely_needed:
    - possibly_new: learning-path-designer
      reason: "Systematic learning path design requires pedagogical expertise"
    - reuse: data-analyst
      reason: "Analyze question patterns to identify Day-1 needs"
    - reuse: doc-writer
      reason: "Write Day-1 onboarding guide"
