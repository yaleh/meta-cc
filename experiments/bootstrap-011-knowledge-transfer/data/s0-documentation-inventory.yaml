# Coverage Analysis
coverage:
  well_documented:
    - CLI interface (docs/reference/cli.md)
    - MCP server (docs/guides/mcp.md)
    - Development workflow (CLAUDE.md)
    - Experiments framework (experiments/*)
    - Methodology (docs/methodology/*)

  partially_documented:
    - Code architecture (proposal exists, no detailed map)
    - Module structure (mentioned, not mapped)
    - Testing strategies (experiment exists, no consolidated guide)

  undocumented:
    - Onboarding paths (no day-1, week-1, month-1 guides)
    - Code navigation (no code map, module explorer)
    - Expert map (no contributor guide, ownership chart)
    - Learning checklist (no progress tracking)
    - Context-aware recommendations (no system)
