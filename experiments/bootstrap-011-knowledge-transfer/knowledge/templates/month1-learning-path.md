#### 1.2 Deep Dive: Architecture Study (4-12 hours)

**For Your Chosen Domain**:

```bash
# 1. Read ALL source files in domain
find internal/{your-domain}/ -name "*.go" | xargs cat

# 2. Read ALL tests
find internal/{your-domain}/ -name "*_test.go" | xargs cat

# 3. Understand data structures
# - What are the key types?
# - What are their invariants?
# - How do they compose?

# 4. Trace data flow
# - Where does input come from?
# - How is it transformed?
# - Where does output go?

# 5. Study design patterns
# - What patterns are used? (Builder, Strategy, Factory, etc.)
# - Why were these patterns chosen?
# - What are the trade-offs?
```

**Domain-Specific Deep Dives**:

**Parser Domain**:
```bash
# Key files to master:
cat internal/parser/parser.go       # Main parser logic
cat internal/parser/types.go        # Data structures
cat internal/parser/session.go      # Session parsing
cat internal/parser/error_handling.go

# Key questions:
# - How does streaming JSONL parsing work?
# - What edge cases are handled? (malformed JSON, large files)
# - How are errors propagated?
# - What's the memory footprint for large sessions?
```

**Query Domain**:
```bash
# Key files to master:
cat internal/query/engine.go        # Query engine
cat internal/query/filter.go        # Filtering logic
cat internal/query/aggregation.go   # Aggregation
cat internal/query/optimization.go  # Performance

# Key questions:
# - How are filters composed?
# - What optimization techniques are used?
# - How is the query plan generated?
# - What's the time complexity for large datasets?
```

**MCP Domain**:
```bash
# Key files to master:
cat cmd/mcp-server/main.go          # Server entry point
cat cmd/mcp-server/tools.go         # Tool implementations
cat cmd/mcp-server/protocol.go      # MCP protocol handling

# Key questions:
# - How does MCP request/response work?
# - How are tools registered and discovered?
# - How is error handling done for protocol errors?
# - What's the integration with core query logic?
```

**Checkpoint**: Can you draw the architecture diagram for your domain from memory?

#### 1.3 Edge Case Study (2-8 hours)

**Systematic Edge Case Discovery**:

```bash
# 1. Review test cases for edge cases
cat internal/{domain}/*_test.go | grep -A5 "edge\|boundary\|invalid\|error"

# 2. Review issues for bugs in your domain
# GitHub: Filter issues by your domain label

# 3. Identify untested edge cases
go test -cover ./internal/{domain}/
# Look for uncovered lines → likely edge cases

# 4. Add tests for edge cases
vim internal/{domain}/edge_cases_test.go
```

**Common Edge Cases by Domain**:

**Parser**:
- Malformed JSON (missing braces, invalid escape sequences)
- Very large files (>100MB sessions)
- Unicode encoding issues
- Concurrent parsing (race conditions)
- Empty sessions, single-line sessions

**Query**:
- Empty result sets
- Very large result sets (>10k items)
- Complex nested filters
- Regex pattern edge cases (catastrophic backtracking)
- NULL/missing field handling

**MCP**:
- Invalid MCP requests
- Timeout handling

- Concurrent tool calls
- Protocol version mismatches

**Checkpoint**: Identified and tested 3+ edge cases in your domain.

#### 1.4 Performance & Optimization Study (2-16 hours)

**Benchmark and Profile**:

```bash
# 1. Run benchmarks for your domain
go test -bench=. ./internal/{domain}/

# 2. Profile CPU usage
go test -cpuprofile cpu.prof -bench=. ./internal/{domain}/
go tool pprof cpu.prof
# (pprof) top10
# (pprof) list {function-name}

# 3. Profile memory allocation
go test -memprofile mem.prof -bench=. ./internal/{domain}/
go tool pprof mem.prof

# 4. Identify optimization opportunities
# - Hot paths (frequently called functions)
# - Memory allocations (can they be reduced?)
# - Algorithmic complexity (can it be improved?)
```

**Domain-Specific Optimizations**:

**Parser**:
- Streaming vs. buffering trade-offs
- JSON unmarshaling optimization (easyjson, jsoniter)
- Memory pooling for large files
- Concurrent parsing for multi-file sessions

**Query**:
- Index structures (maps, tries, bloom filters)
- Query plan optimization
- Filter short-circuiting
- Result pagination and streaming

**MCP**:
- Response caching (15-min cache for WebFetch)

### Learning Objectives
- Review others' PRs in your domain
- Answer questions from contributors
- Write advanced guides and documentation
- Mentor new contributors through onboarding
- Participate in project governance (RFC discussions)

### Steps

#### 4.1 Code Review Participation (2-8 hours)

**Effective Code Review**:

```bash
# 1. Find PRs in your domain to review
gh pr list --label "{domain}"

# 2. Review checklist:
# - [ ] Does it solve the stated problem?
# - [ ] Is the design sound? (fits architecture)
# - [ ] Are tests comprehensive? (coverage, edge cases)
# - [ ] Is code readable? (naming, comments)
# - [ ] Are there performance concerns?
# - [ ] Is documentation updated?

# 3. Provide constructive feedback
# - Praise good work
# - Suggest improvements (not demands)
# - Explain reasoning
# - Offer to pair if complex

# Example review comments:
```

**Good Review Comment**:
```markdown
Nice work on implementing {feature}! The test coverage is excellent.

A few suggestions:
1. **Performance**: The current implementation is O(n²) on line 42.
   Consider using a map for O(n) lookup. See {example} for similar pattern.

2. **Error handling**: What happens if {edge-case}?
   Suggest adding validation at line 56.

3. **Naming**: `processData` is a bit generic.
   Perhaps `extractToolMetrics` would be clearer?

Let me know if you'd like to pair on the optimization part!
```

**Checkpoint**: Reviewed 3+ PRs in your domain with constructive feedback.

#### 4.2 Answer Questions & Discussions (1-4 hours)

**Community Participation**:

```bash
# 1. Monitor GitHub discussions for questions in your domain
gh issue list --label "question,{domain}"

# 2. Answer questions with:
# - Clear explanation
# - Code examples
# - Links to relevant docs
# - Offer to update docs if question is common

# Example answer:
```

**Good Answer**:
```markdown
Great question! The parser handles malformed JSON by {explanation}.

Here's how it works:

```go
// Example code showing error handling
parser.Parse(jsonLine)
// Returns error if JSON is malformed
```

You can see this in action in `internal/parser/parser_test.go`,
specifically the `TestMalformedJSON` test case.

For more details, see the [Parser Guide](docs/guides/parser-guide.md#error-handling).

If this doesn't answer your question, let me know!
```

**Checkpoint**: Answered 5+ questions in your domain.

#### 4.3 Write Advanced Documentation (2-6 hours)

**Domain Expert Guides**:

```bash
# 1. Identify documentation gaps for advanced users
# - Advanced features not documented
# - Performance tuning guides missing
# - Troubleshooting guides incomplete

# 2. Write expert-level guide
vim docs/guides/{domain}-advanced.md
```

**Advanced Guide Template**:
