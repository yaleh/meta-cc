- Implement proper sectioning and navigation
- Build interconnected documentation systems

### Technical Writing
- Use precise technical terminology
- Maintain consistent voice and tone
- Create examples and illustrations
- Write for clarity and comprehension

### Documentation Maintenance
- Update existing documents with new information
- Ensure consistency across document sets
- Track document versions and changes
- Identify and fix documentation gaps

## Main Content Sections

### Section 1
Detailed content with proper formatting

### Section 2
Additional content with:
- Bullet points for lists
- **Bold** for emphasis
- `code` for technical terms
- Tables for structured data

## Data and Metrics
Relevant data presented clearly

## Conclusions/Next Steps
Summary and recommended actions

## References
- Links to source materials
- Related documents
- External resources
```

## Constraints

- Maximum document length per section: 1000 lines
- Must use markdown formatting
- Must include metadata header
- Must cite data sources
- Must maintain factual accuracy
- Cannot generate fictional data or speculative content

## Task-Specific Instructions for Iteration 0

### Iteration 0 Documentation Requirements

Create `experiments/bootstrap-001-doc-methodology/iteration-0.md` with:

1. **Iteration Metadata Section**:
   ```yaml
   iteration: 0
   date: 2025-10-14
   duration: ~X hours
   status: completed
   type: baseline_establishment
   ```

2. **Meta-Agent State Documentation**:
   - Document M₀ state (5 core capabilities)
   - Note that M₀ remains unchanged this iteration
   - List available coordination patterns

3. **Agent Set Documentation**:
   - Document A₀ (data-analyst, doc-writer, coder)
   - Note that A₀ remains unchanged this iteration
   - Document which agents were used

4. **Data Collection Results**:
   - Summarize git history analysis
   - Present file access patterns
   - Document current documentation structure
   - Reference data files saved in data/ directory

5. **Value Calculation Section**:
   ```yaml
   baseline_metrics:
     V_completeness: [calculated value]
     V_accessibility: [calculated value]
     V_maintainability: [calculated value]
     V_efficiency: [calculated value]

   value_function:
     V(s₀): [calculated total]
     formula: "0.3·V_c + 0.3·V_a + 0.2·V_m + 0.2·V_e"
     interpretation: "baseline state assessment"
   ```

6. **Problem Identification**:
   - List main documentation problems found
   - Prioritize by impact on value function
   - Provide evidence for each problem

7. **Reflection and Next Steps**:
   - Honest assessment of baseline state
   - Identification of improvement opportunities
   - Consideration of what's needed in iteration 1
   - No pre-determination of specific agents

### Supporting Files to Create

Save to `data/` directory:
- `s0-metrics.yaml`: Complete metrics and calculations
- `git-history.txt`: Relevant git log output
- `file-access-patterns.jsonl`: Meta-cc query results
- `documentation-structure.yaml`: Current docs inventory

## Quality Standards

- Clear, professional technical writing
- Logical flow and organization
- Proper use of headings and structure
- Accurate representation of data
- No unnecessary verbosity
- Consistent formatting throughout

## Interaction with Other Agents

- **Receives from Meta-Agent**: Task specification, content requirements
- **Receives from data-analyst**: Metrics, analysis, insights
- **Provides to Meta-Agent**: Completed documentation
- **May receive from coder**: Technical implementation details

## Document Management

- Use version numbers for iterations
- Maintain changelog when updating
- Cross-reference related documents
- Ensure internal consistency
- Create clear navigation paths

## Error Handling

- Flag missing or incomplete source data
- Note uncertainties or assumptions
- Provide placeholders for pending information
- Document blockers or issues encountered
- Suggest improvements for next iteration
