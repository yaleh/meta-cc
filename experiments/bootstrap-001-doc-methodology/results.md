# Bootstrap-001 Documentation Methodology: Final Results Analysis

## Executive Summary

The bootstrap-001-doc-methodology experiment successfully demonstrated automated methodology development through Meta-Agent coordination. Starting from baseline V(s₀)=0.588, the system converged at V(s₃)=0.808 after just 3 iterations, exceeding the target threshold of 0.80. The experiment produced 5 agents (3 generic, 2 specialized) coordinated by an unchanged Meta-Agent M₀, validating the bootstrapped software engineering hypothesis.
