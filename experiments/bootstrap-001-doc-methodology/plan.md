## Objective

**Primary Goal**: Simulate a Meta-Agent/Agent bootstrapping iteration process using real meta-cc project history to demonstrate the three-tuple output (O, Aₙ, Mₙ) and convergence.

**Specific Goals**:
1. Apply the Bootstrapped Software Engineering methodology (docs/methodology/bootstrapped-software-engineering.md)
2. Use Value Space Optimization framework (docs/methodology/value-space-optimization.md)
3. Execute OCA Framework (Observe-Codify-Automate) from empirical-methodology-development.md
4. Record complete three-tuple evolution: (Mᵢ, Aᵢ) at each iteration
5. Demonstrate convergence: ‖Mₙ - Mₙ₋₁‖ < ε AND ‖Aₙ - Aₙ₋₁‖ < ε

---

## Task Definition

**Task T**: Develop a data-driven documentation methodology for the meta-cc project

**Context**:
- Historical period: 2025-10-10 to 2025-10-13 (commits d95dac8, d339107, be222e8)
- Initial state: Documentation scattered, no methodology
- Target output: role-based-documentation.md + automated capabilities

**Value Function V(s)**:
```
V(s) = w₁·V_doc_completeness(s) +      # Documentation covers all features
       w₂·V_doc_accessibility(s) +      # Easy to find information
       w₃·V_doc_maintainability(s) +    # Easy to keep docs up-to-date
       w₄·V_token_efficiency(s)         # Lower token cost for Claude

Weights (project-specific):
  w₁ = 0.3  # Completeness is key
  w₂ = 0.3  # Accessibility matters (Claude needs to find info)
  w₃ = 0.2  # Maintainability (living system)
  w₄ = 0.2  # Token efficiency (cost optimization)
```

**Success Metrics**:
- Documentation completeness: 100% (all features documented)
- Resolution rate: ≥80% (questions answered from docs)
- Token efficiency: CLAUDE.md ≤300 lines
- Methodology codified: role-based-documentation.md created
- Automation achieved: meta-doc-* capabilities implemented

---

## Theoretical Framework

### Value Space Model

**State Space S**: Project documentation state
```
s = (doc_files, doc_structure, access_patterns, metrics)

Dimensions:
  - doc_files: {README.md, CLAUDE.md, guides/*.md, reference/*.md, ...}
  - doc_structure: Directory organization, navigation paths
  - access_patterns: Read/Edit ratios, access density, implicit loading
  - metrics: Total lines, token cost, resolution rate, follow-up questions
```

**Development Trajectory τ**:
```
τ = [s₀, s₁, s₂, ..., sₙ]

where:
  s₀ = Initial state (README.md 1909 lines, scattered docs)
  s₁ = After role classification analysis
  s₂ = After methodology codification
  sₙ = Converged state (methodology + automation)
```

### Agent as Gradient ∇V

**Agent A(s)** approximates the gradient:
```
A: S → ΔS
A(s) ≈ ∇V(s) = direction of steepest value ascent in doc space

Example Agents:
  A_data_analyzer: "Analyze access patterns" → ∇V in data dimension
  A_classifier: "Classify document roles" → ∇V in structure dimension
  A_methodologist: "Extract principles" → ∇V in methodology dimension
  A_automator: "Create capabilities" → ∇V in automation dimension
```

### Meta-Agent as Hessian ∇²V

**Meta-Agent M(s, A)** approximates the Hessian:
```
M: (S, {Aᵢ}) → A*
M(s, A₁, ..., Aₖ) = optimal agent selection

Uses curvature (second derivatives) to determine:
  - Which agent to invoke next
  - When to create new specialized agents
  - When agents are sufficient (convergence)
```

### Three-Tuple Output

**Goal**: Produce (O, Aₙ, Mₙ) where:
```
O  = Task output (role-based-documentation.md + capabilities)
Aₙ = Converged agent set (reusable for similar doc tasks)
Mₙ = Converged meta-agent (transferable to new domains)

Reusability Test:
  - Can Aₙ be applied to other documentation projects?
  - Can Mₙ guide similar methodology development tasks?
```

## Initial State

### M₀: Primitive Meta-Agent

**Capabilities** (minimal viable):
```yaml
M₀:
  observe:
    - "Can query historical data (git log, meta-cc tools)"
    - "Can analyze patterns in data"

  plan:
    - "Can break task into subtasks"
    - "Can sequence operations"

  execute:
    - "Can invoke generic agents"
    - "Can read/write documentation"

  reflect:
    - "Can evaluate output quality"
    - "Can detect when task incomplete"

  evolve:
    - "Can create new specialized agents when needed"
    - "Can add capabilities to self"
```

### A₀: Initial Agent Set

**Generic agents** (broad capability, low specialization):
```yaml
A₀:
  - name: generic-data-analyst
    role: "Analyze any data and find patterns"
    specialization: low

  - name: generic-doc-writer
    role: "Write documentation for any purpose"
    specialization: low

  - name: generic-coder
    role: "Write code for any task"
    specialization: low
```

### Project State s₀

**Baseline** (from git history ~2025-10-10):
```yaml
s₀:
  documentation:
    - README.md: 275 lines (after 85% reduction)
    - CLAUDE.md: 607 lines (needs optimization)
    - docs/: ~14,000 lines total
    - Structure: Some organization but no methodology

  metrics:
    - doc_completeness: 0.85
    - resolution_rate: 0.68  # 68% questions answered from docs
    - token_efficiency: poor (CLAUDE.md 607 lines)
    - follow_up_rate: 0.45  # 45% require follow-up

  value:
    V(s₀) = 0.3*0.85 + 0.3*0.68 + 0.2*0.5 + 0.2*0.3 = 0.52
```

## Iteration Plan

### Iteration 0: Baseline Establishment

**Goal**: Understand current state and establish baseline

**M₀ Actions**:
1. Collect historical data (git log, meta-cc queries)
2. Analyze current documentation structure
3. Identify key problems and opportunities

**Expected Output**:
- Data collection complete
- Problem statement identified
- Baseline metrics calculated: V(s₀)

**Agent Evolution**: A₀ unchanged
**Meta-Agent Evolution**: M₀ unchanged

---

### Subsequent Iterations: Guided by Meta-Agent

**Process**: Let M evolve naturally by:
1. **Observing** the current state and task requirements
2. **Planning** the next step based on what's needed
3. **Executing** by invoking existing agents or creating new specialized agents
4. **Reflecting** on output quality and gaps
5. **Evolving** by adding capabilities or agents as needed

**Convergence Criteria**:
```yaml
convergence_occurs_when:
  - ‖Mₙ - Mₙ₋₁‖ < ε  (no new meta-agent capabilities)
  - ‖Aₙ - Aₙ₋₁‖ < ε  (no new agents created)
  - V(sₙ) ≥ V_target (value threshold met)
  - All task objectives completed
```

**Do NOT pre-define**:
- Specific agent names or specializations
- Number of iterations needed
- Exact evolution path (M₁, M₂, M₃...)
- Detailed value predictions

**Instead, let the system discover**:
- Which agents are needed (based on task gaps)
- When to specialize (based on generic agent insufficiency)
- When to add meta-agent capabilities (based on coordination needs)
- When convergence is achieved (based on formal criteria)

---

## Success Criteria

### Task-Level Success

**Required**:
- [x] Methodology document created (role-based-documentation.md)
- [x] 6 document roles defined with clear criteria
- [x] Classification algorithm codified
- [x] 4 automated capabilities implemented
- [x] Self-application successful (used on meta-cc docs)

**Metrics**:
- V(sₙ) ≥ 0.80 (target value reached)
- Resolution rate ≥ 80% (questions answered from docs)
- Token efficiency improved (CLAUDE.md optimized)

### Convergence Success

**Agent Set**:
- A₄ = A₃ (no new agents needed)
- All agents have clear, non-overlapping roles
- Agents can be reused for similar documentation tasks

**Meta-Agent**:
- M₄ = M₃ (no new capabilities needed)
- Can guide similar methodology development tasks
- Selection policy learned and effective

### Three-Tuple Output

**Output O** (Expected deliverables):
- Methodology document describing document role classification
- Automated capabilities for methodology validation
- Total: ~2000-3000 lines estimated

**Agent Set Aₙ**:
- Will emerge based on task needs
- Expect mix of specialized + generic agents
- To be discovered during iteration

**Meta-Agent Mₙ**:
- Will start with M₀ (5 core capabilities)
- Will gain additional capabilities as needed
- Final capability count and policy to be discovered

### Reusability Validation

After convergence, test reusability by:
1. **Transfer Test 1**: Apply (Aₙ, Mₙ) to new documentation project
   - Measure: iterations needed, agent reuse rate
2. **Transfer Test 2**: Apply (Aₙ, Mₙ) to different domain
   - Measure: which agents transfer, adaptation effort

Execute iterations until convergence:
- Start with Iteration 0 (baseline)
- Each iteration: Observe → Plan → Execute → Reflect → Evolve
- Continue until convergence criteria met
- Document each iteration in `iteration-N.md`
