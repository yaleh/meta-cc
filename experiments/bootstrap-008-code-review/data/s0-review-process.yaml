current_review_process:
  type: manual_ad_hoc
  maturity_level: minimal
  description: "No systematic code review process exists beyond basic development practices"

existing_practices:
  formatting:
    - tool: gofmt
      coverage: all_files
      automation: yes (via Makefile + CI)
      effectiveness: high
      notes: "Standard Go formatting, well-integrated"

  basic_linting:
    - tool: go_vet
      coverage: all_packages
      automation: yes (via Makefile + CI)
      effectiveness: medium
      notes: "Catches basic issues (unreachable code, nil dereferences)"

  testing:
    - practice: unit_tests
      coverage: 82% average (32.5% - 93.6% range)
      automation: yes (CI runs all tests)
      effectiveness: high (most modules well-tested)
      gaps: "validation/ module only 32.5% coverage"

    - practice: test_coverage_enforcement
      target: 80%
      automation: yes (Makefile checks coverage)
      effectiveness: medium
      notes: "Target not enforced in CI, validation module below target"

  manual_review:
    - practice: ad_hoc_code_inspection
      frequency: irregular
      coverage: incomplete
      documentation: none
      effectiveness: low
      notes: "No systematic review process, relies on developer discretion"
