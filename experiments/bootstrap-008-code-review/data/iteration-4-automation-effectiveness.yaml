  analysis: |
    Simulation OVERESTIMATED direct issue overlap (31.4% vs 11.8% actual)
    but UNDERESTIMATED novel findings (0 vs 44 actual).

    Real effectiveness (33.1%) HIGHER than simulated (29.8%) because:
    - Novel issues (44) add value beyond simple overlap
    - Automation catches different issue types than manual review
    - Combined approach (automation + manual) is more thorough

  conclusion: "Automation complements manual review rather than replacing it"

# ROI Analysis
roi_analysis:
  setup_time: 2.5h  # Creating .golangci.yml, .pre-commit-config.yaml, scripts (iteration 3)
  deployment_time: 0.25h  # Installing golangci-lint, gosec, pre-commit (iteration 4)
  total_investment: 2.75h

  time_saved_per_review_cycle: 2.16h  # From this iteration
  break_even_point: 1.27  # 2.75 / 2.16 = 1.27 review cycles

  cumulative_savings:
    iteration_4: 2.16h
    iteration_5_projected: 4.32h  # 2.16 × 2
    iteration_6_projected: 6.48h  # 2.16 × 3

  roi_after_iteration_4: -21.5%  # (2.16 - 2.75) / 2.75 = -21.5% (not yet positive)
  roi_after_iteration_5_projected: 57.1%  # (4.32 - 2.75) / 2.75 = 57.1%
  roi_after_iteration_6_projected: 135.6%  # (6.48 - 2.75) / 2.75 = 135.6%

  recommendation: "Continue using automation - ROI becomes positive in iteration 5"

# Impact on Review Workflow
workflow_impact:
  before_automation:
    step1: "Manual review using checklist"
    step2: "Document all issues manually"
    step3: "Categorize and prioritize manually"
    total_time: 6.52h

  after_automation:
    step1: "Run golangci-lint + gosec (automated)"  # 0.12h
    step2: "Review automation findings"             # 0.5h
    step3: "Manual review for semantic issues"      # 3.74h
    step4: "Combine and prioritize all issues"      # 0.5h
    total_time: 4.36h

  iteration_reduction:
    before: "2.5 review cycles average (rework due to missed issues)"
    after: "1.625 cycles average (35% reduction)"
    explanation: "Pre-commit hooks catch issues before they enter review"

# Key Insights
insights:
  - "Automation found 44 NEW issues manual review missed (field alignment, style)"
  - "Automation complements manual review (different issue types)"
  - "11.8% direct overlap lower than expected, but 69.7% combined coverage"
  - "33.1% time savings achieved (vs 29.8% simulated)"
  - "Zero false positives from automation (high precision)"
  - "ROI positive after 1.27 review cycles (iteration 5)"
  - "Critical issues (VALIDATION-005/006) still require manual review"

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  - "Keep automation enabled (net positive after iteration 5)"
  - "Use automation FIRST, then manual review for semantic issues"
  - "Lower priority of fieldalignment issues (micro-optimizations)"
  - "Implement custom linter for O(n*m) pattern detection (Strategy 5)"
  - "Add test coverage enforcement (Strategy 4)"
  - "Consider CI/CD integration for automated PR checks (Strategy 6)"
