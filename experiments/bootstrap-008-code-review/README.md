# Experiment: Meta-Agent Bootstrapping for Code Review Methodology

**Experiment ID**: bootstrap-008-code-review
**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: ⏳ READY TO START
**Framework**: Bootstrapped Software Engineering + Value Space Optimization

---

## Overview

This experiment demonstrates Meta-Agent/Agent bootstrapping for developing a comprehensive code review methodology and automated review infrastructure. It applies the proven three-methodology framework to the code quality domain, developing both concrete code review capabilities and reusable review methodology.

**Key Objective**: Perform comprehensive code review of meta-cc's internal/ package while simultaneously extracting transferable code review methodology.

**Dual-Layer Architecture**:
- **Meta-Objective** (Methodology Layer): Extract reusable code review methodology
- **Instance Objective** (Implementation Layer): Perform production-ready code review of internal/ package

---

## Methodological Foundation

This experiment applies three integrated methodologies:

1. **Empirical Methodology Development** ([docs/methodology/empirical-methodology-development.md](../../docs/methodology/empirical-methodology-development.md))
   - Observe → Codify → Automate (OCA) framework for review patterns

2. **Bootstrapped Software Engineering** ([docs/methodology/bootstrapped-software-engineering.md](../../docs/methodology/bootstrapped-software-engineering.md))
   - Three-tuple iteration: (Mᵢ, Aᵢ) = Mᵢ₋₁(T, Aᵢ₋₁)
   - Convergence when ‖Mₙ - Mₙ₋₁‖ < ε and ‖Aₙ - Aₙ₋₁‖ < ε

3. **Value Space Optimization** ([docs/methodology/value-space-optimization.md](../../docs/methodology/value-space-optimization.md))
   - Agent as gradient: A(s) ≈ ∇V_instance(s) (perform better reviews)
   - Meta-Agent as Hessian: M(s, A) ≈ ∇²V_meta(s) (improve methodology)

---

## Task Definition

### Instance Task (Code Review Execution)

**Task T_instance**: Perform comprehensive code review of meta-cc internal/ package

**Context**:
- Target codebase: `internal/` package (~15,000 lines of Go code)
- Review scope: Correctness, maintainability, readability, security, performance
- Current state: No systematic review process, manual ad-hoc reviews
- Expected outcome: Review reports, issue catalog, improvement recommendations

**Instance Value Function V_instance(s)**:
```
V_instance(s) = 0.3·V_issue_detection(s) +    # Issue finding rate
                0.3·V_false_positive(s) +     # Low false positives
                0.2·V_actionability(s) +      # Actionable feedback
                0.2·V_learning(s)             # Team learning value

Components:
  V_issue_detection:  (real_issues_found / total_actual_issues)
  V_false_positive:   1 - (false_positives / total_issues_reported)
  V_actionability:    (actionable_recommendations / total_recommendations)
  V_learning:         (patterns_documented / patterns_identified)

Target: V_instance(s_N) ≥ 0.80
```

**Success Metrics**:
- Issue detection: ≥70% of actual issues found (high recall)
- False positive rate: ≤20% (high precision)
- Actionability: ≥80% of recommendations are concrete and implementable
- Learning value: ≥75% of identified patterns documented for team learning

### Meta Task (Methodology Development)

**Task T_meta**: Extract reusable code review methodology

**Context**:
- Observe agent work on concrete code review
- Identify patterns in review decisions
- Codify methodology for future code reviews

**Meta Value Function V_meta(s)**:
```
V_meta(s) = 0.4·V_methodology_completeness(s) +    # Documentation coverage
            0.3·V_methodology_effectiveness(s) +   # Efficiency improvement
            0.3·V_methodology_reusability(s)       # Transferability

Components:
  V_completeness:   (documented_patterns / total_patterns)
  V_effectiveness:  speedup_on_transfer_tests
  V_reusability:    successful_transfers / transfer_attempts

Target: V_meta(s_N) ≥ 0.80
```

### M₀: Meta-Agent (Inherited from Bootstrap-007)

**Architecture**: Modular capability files in `meta-agents/`

```yaml
M₀:
  version: 1.0 (from Bootstrap-007, originally Bootstrap-006)
  architecture: modular
  capability_files:
    - observe.md       # Data collection, pattern discovery
