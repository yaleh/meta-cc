# Knowledge Index: Bootstrap-008 Code Review Methodology

**Experiment**: bootstrap-008-code-review
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Purpose**: Track extracted knowledge from code review methodology development

---

## Overview

This index catalogs all knowledge artifacts extracted during the Bootstrap-008 experiment. Knowledge is organized into five categories:

1. **Patterns** (domain-specific): Specific solutions to recurring problems in code review
2. **Principles** (universal): Fundamental truths or rules discovered
3. **Templates** (reusable): Concrete implementations ready for reuse
4. **Best Practices** (context-specific): Recommended approaches for specific contexts
5. **Methodology** (project-wide): Comprehensive guides for reuse across projects

### Best Practices (Context-Specific)

**Location**: `knowledge/best-practices/`
**Format**: `{topic}.md`

**Description**: Recommended approaches for specific contexts (e.g., Go-specific).

**Template**:
```markdown
# Best Practice: Topic

**Context**: [When this best practice applies]
**Recommendation**: [What to do]
**Justification**: [Why this is best practice]

### Methodology (Project-Wide)

**Location**: `../../docs/methodology/`
**Format**: `{methodology-name}.md`

**Description**: Comprehensive guides for reuse across projects (not experiment-specific).

**Template**:
```markdown
# Methodology: Name

**Purpose**: [What this methodology achieves]
**Scope**: [What domains/projects this applies to]
**Framework**: [High-level process overview]
**Decision Criteria**: [How to make decisions in this methodology]
**Automation Strategies**: [What to automate, how]
**Transfer Validation**: [Evidence of reusability]
**Source Experiment**: [bootstrap-008-code-review]

**Applicability**: [% of projects this applies to]
```

**Entries**: (Populated during experiment iterations)

---

## Validation Status

**Proposed**: Pattern/principle/template identified but not yet validated
**Validated**: Applied successfully at least once, shows promise
**Refined**: Applied multiple times, refined based on feedback

---

## Domain Tags

**Code Review**: code-review, review-process, issue-detection
**Go Language**: go, go-idioms, go-best-practices, error-handling, naming
**Quality**: correctness, maintainability, readability, security, performance
**Automation**: linting, static-analysis, pre-commit-hooks, ci-cd
**Methodology**: process, framework, decision-criteria, transfer

## Knowledge Extraction Protocol

When extracting knowledge during iterations:

1. **Identify**: Observe patterns, principles, or best practices during review work
2. **Document**: Create appropriate file in knowledge/{category}/
3. **Index**: Add entry to this INDEX.md with:
   - File path
   - Brief description
   - Source iteration
   - Validation status
   - Domain tags
4. **Link**: Reference from iteration-N.md where extracted
5. **Validate**: Test applicability, refine as needed

**Iterations 1-2** (Observe Phase):
- Expected: 5-10 patterns (review patterns observed)
- Expected: 2-5 principles (quality principles discovered)
- Expected: 0-2 best practices (Go-specific practices noted)

**Iterations 3-4** (Codify Phase):
- Expected: 3-5 templates (review checklists, issue report templates)
- Expected: 5-10 best practices (Go idioms, error handling, naming)
- Expected: 1 methodology (code review methodology documentation start)

**Iterations 5-6** (Automate Phase):
- Expected: 2-5 templates (linting configs, automation scripts)
- Expected: 1 methodology (code review methodology refinement and validation)

**Total Expected**:
- Patterns: 5-10
- Principles: 2-5
- Templates: 5-10
- Best Practices: 5-15
- Methodology: 1 (comprehensive)
