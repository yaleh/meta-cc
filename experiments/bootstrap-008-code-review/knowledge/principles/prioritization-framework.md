# Code Review Issue Prioritization Framework

**Purpose**: Systematic framework for assigning priority scores to code review issues based on severity, effort, and ROI.

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: Validated (applied to 76 issues across 4 modules)

---

## Priority Calculation Formula

```
Priority Score = (Severity_Weight × Severity_Score) - (Effort_Factor × Effort_Score)

Where:
- Severity_Weight = 10 (high weight on severity)
- Effort_Factor = 3 (moderate weight on effort)
- Higher score = Higher priority
```

**Ranking**:
- **P0 (Critical)**: Score ≥ 35 (fix immediately)
- **P1 (High)**: Score 25-34 (fix this iteration)
- **P2 (Medium)**: Score 15-24 (fix next iteration)
- **P3 (Low)**: Score < 15 (defer or backlog)

---

## Severity Scoring Rubric

### Severity: CRITICAL (Score: 10)

**Criteria** (any one triggers critical):
- **Broken Core Functionality**: Feature doesn't work at all
  - Example: VALIDATION-005/006 - ordering validation completely non-functional
- **Complex Code with 0% Test Coverage**: High-risk untested logic
  - Example: VALIDATION-001 - parser.go (158 lines regex parsing, no tests)
- **Security Vulnerability + Feasible Exploit**: Attackable vulnerability
  - Example: SQL injection in user-facing input

**Impact**: Production failure, security breach, data loss
**Timeframe**: Fix immediately (same iteration)

### Severity: HIGH (Score: 7)

**Criteria**:
- **Severe Performance Issue**: O(n²) or worse, noticeable slowdown
  - Example: QUERY-005 - O(n*m) iteration (1000 × 5000 = 5M iterations)
- **Panic Risk**: Missing nil checks, unchecked array access
  - Example: QUERY-007 - missing entries parameter validation
- **Major Test Coverage Gap**: Critical module < 50% coverage
  - Example: validation/ at 32.5% coverage

**Impact**: Performance degradation, potential crashes, risk of regressions
**Timeframe**: Fix within 1-2 iterations

### Severity: MEDIUM (Score: 4)

**Criteria**:
- **Maintainability Issues**: Hard-coded constants, code duplication
  - Example: QUERY-003 - hard-coded tool names in 6+ locations
- **Missing Error Handling**: Error not returned or logged
  - Example: QUERY-002 - parseTimestamp returns 0 on error (ambiguous)
- **Readability Issues**: Poor naming, missing documentation
  - Example: ANALYZER-009 - magic numbers without constants

**Impact**: Technical debt, maintenance burden, confusion
**Timeframe**: Fix within 2-3 iterations

### Severity: LOW (Score: 1)

**Criteria**:
- **Minor Style Issues**: Variable naming (camelCase vs snake_case)
  - Example: currentTs should be currentTS
- **Cosmetic Improvements**: Better formatting, minor refactoring
- **Nice-to-Have Features**: Non-essential enhancements

**Impact**: Minimal, mostly aesthetic
**Timeframe**: Fix when convenient or defer

---

## Effort Scoring Rubric

### Effort: TRIVIAL (Score: 1)

**Characteristics**:
- Single-line fix
- No tests required (or trivial test change)
- No dependencies
- < 15 minutes

- 20-100 line change
- Multiple function changes
- Comprehensive test suite needed
- 1-4 hours

**Examples**:
- Fix O(n*m) iteration (build index map)
- Add comprehensive tests for parser.go
- Refactor code duplication across files

### Effort: LARGE (Score: 8)

**Characteristics**:
- 100+ line change

## Priority Examples (Real Issues from Bootstrap-008)

### P0 (Critical Priority)

**VALIDATION-005** - Broken Ordering Validation:
- Severity: CRITICAL (10) - broken core functionality
- Effort: SMALL (3)
- **Score: (10 × 10) - (3 × 3) = 91**
- **Action**: Fix immediately ✅ FIXED in iteration 4

**VALIDATION-001** - Parser with 0% Coverage:
- Severity: CRITICAL (10) - complex untested code
- Effort: MEDIUM (5)
- **Score: (10 × 10) - (3 × 5) = 85**
- **Action**: Fix immediately ✅ FIXED in iteration 4

### P1 (High Priority)

**QUERY-005** - O(n*m) Performance Issue:
- Severity: HIGH (7) - severe performance issue
- Effort: MEDIUM (5)
- **Score: (10 × 7) - (3 × 5) = 55**
- **Action**: Fix this iteration or next

**QUERY-007** - Missing Nil Check (Panic Risk):
- Severity: HIGH (7) - panic risk
- Effort: TRIVIAL (1)
- **Score: (10 × 7) - (3 × 1) = 67**
- **Action**: Fix this iteration (high ROI!)

### P2 (Medium Priority)

**QUERY-003** - Hard-Coded Tool Names:
- Severity: MEDIUM (4) - maintainability issue
- Effort: MEDIUM (5)
- **Score: (10 × 4) - (3 × 5) = 25**
- **Action**: Fix within 2-3 iterations

**ANALYZER-009** - Magic Numbers:
- Severity: MEDIUM (4) - readability issue
- Effort: SMALL (3)
- **Score: (10 × 4) - (3 × 3) = 31**
- **Action**: Fix next iteration

### P3 (Low Priority)

**ANALYZER-014** - Variable Naming (currentTs):
- Severity: LOW (1) - style issue
- Effort: TRIVIAL (1)
- **Score: (10 × 1) - (3 × 1) = 7**
- **Action**: Fix when convenient, or defer

---

## ROI (Return on Investment) Analysis

**ROI Formula**:
```
ROI = Severity_Score / Effort_Score
```

**High ROI Examples** (maximum impact for minimal effort):
- QUERY-007: Severity 7 / Effort 1 = **ROI 7.0** (excellent!)
- VALIDATION-005: Severity 10 / Effort 3 = **ROI 3.33** (great!)
- ANALYZER-014: Severity 1 / Effort 1 = **ROI 1.0** (low value)

**Strategic Decision**: Prioritize high-ROI issues first within each priority tier.

## Iteration Planning Guidelines

### Iteration Capacity Model

**Time Budget**: 6-8 hours per iteration

**Capacity by Effort**:
- TRIVIAL (1): ~15 minutes each → can fix 8-12 per hour
- SMALL (3): ~1 hour each → can fix 6-8 per iteration
- MEDIUM (5): ~3 hours each → can fix 2-3 per iteration
- LARGE (8): ~6 hours each → can fix 1 per iteration

### Recommended Iteration Mix

**Balanced Iteration** (maximize value):
- 1-2 CRITICAL issues (must fix)
- 2-3 HIGH issues (prioritize high-ROI)
- 3-5 MEDIUM issues (if time permits)
- 5-10 LOW issues (quick wins for morale)

**Focus Iteration** (depth over breadth):
- 1 LARGE issue (major refactoring)
- 2-3 related MEDIUM issues
- Skip LOW issues

**Quick Wins Iteration** (momentum):
- 0 LARGE issues
- 5-8 HIGH/MEDIUM high-ROI issues
- 10-15 TRIVIAL fixes

## Automation Impact on Prioritization

### Automatable Issue Priority Adjustment

**Linter-Detectable Issues** (reduce priority by 1 tier):
- Magic numbers (goconst) → Can be auto-detected
- Unchecked errors (errcheck) → Can be auto-caught
- Style violations (stylecheck) → Can be auto-fixed
- Complexity (gocyclo) → Can be auto-flagged

**Rationale**: If automation will catch it, manual review priority decreases.

**Example**:
- Manual priority: QUERY-003 hard-coded constants = P2 (Medium)
- With goconst enabled: P3 (Low) - golangci-lint will catch it

### Non-Automatable Issues (maintain high priority):
- Architecture/design issues
- Logic errors
- Domain-specific patterns
- Complex correctness issues

## Decision Trees

### Should I Fix This Issue Now?

```
Is it CRITICAL severity?
├─ YES → Fix immediately (P0)
└─ NO → Continue...

Is it HIGH severity AND high ROI (ROI > 3.0)?
├─ YES → Fix this iteration (P1)
└─ NO → Continue...

Is it automatable by linter?
├─ YES → Defer until automation deployed (P3)
└─ NO → Continue...

Is effort MEDIUM or LARGE?
├─ YES → Schedule for dedicated iteration (P2)
└─ NO → Fix when convenient (P3)
```

### Should I Create a Custom Linter?

```
Is pattern recurring (3+ occurrences)?
└─ NO → Manual fix only
   YES → Continue...

Is pattern automatable?
└─ NO → Document as best practice
   YES → Continue...

What's the detection rate?
└─ < 50% → Too many false positives, skip
   ≥ 50% → Continue...

What's the implementation effort?
└─ > 8 hours → Defer, not worth it yet
   ≤ 8 hours → Implement custom linter
```

## Integration with Code Review Checklist

**Checklist Update**: Add priority scoring step:

1. Identify issue (correctness, performance, etc.)
2. Assign severity (critical/high/medium/low)
3. Estimate effort (trivial/small/medium/large)
4. Calculate priority score
5. Check if automatable (adjust priority)
6. Document in issue catalog with priority

**Template**:
```yaml
- id: MODULE-XXX
  severity: [critical|high|medium|low]
  effort: [trivial|small|medium|large]
  priority_score: XX
  priority: [P0|P1|P2|P3]
  automatable: [yes|no]
  roi: X.XX
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Weighted Categories**: Adjust severity weights by category (security × 1.5)
2. **Historical Data**: Use bug rate to refine severity scores
3. **Team Velocity**: Calibrate effort scores based on actual time
4. **Automated Scoring**: Tool to calculate priority from issue YAML
5. **Priority Tracking**: Dashboard showing P0/P1/P2/P3 distribution
