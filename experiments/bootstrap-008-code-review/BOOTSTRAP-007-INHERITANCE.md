# Bootstrap-007 Inheritance Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Source**: Bootstrap-007 (CI/CD Pipeline Optimization)
**Target**: Bootstrap-008 (Code Review Methodology)

---

## Overview

Bootstrap-008 starts with the **converged state** from Bootstrap-007, inheriting both Meta-Agent capabilities and the complete agent set. This represents a **transfer learning** approach where validated capabilities and agents are reused across domains.

**Key Innovation**: This is the first experiment to inherit from a **CI/CD domain** and apply it to a **code quality domain**, demonstrating cross-domain methodology transfer.

## Inherited Components

### 1. Meta-Agent M₀ (6 Capability Files)

## Rationale for Inheritance

### 1. Transfer Learning Across Quality Domains
- Bootstrap-007 focused on **CI/CD quality** (pipeline quality, automation quality)
- Bootstrap-008 focuses on **code quality** (readability, maintainability, correctness)
- Both share common quality assurance patterns:
  - Automated checking (CI pipelines ↔ linters/static analyzers)
  - Quality gates (build gates ↔ code review gates)
  - Continuous improvement (pipeline optimization ↔ code refactoring)
  - Error detection and prevention (CI failures ↔ code issues)

### 2. Validated Meta-Agent Capabilities
- Meta-Agent capabilities are domain-agnostic (observe, plan, execute, reflect, evolve)
- Successfully applied in API Design (Bootstrap-006) and CI/CD (Bootstrap-007)
- Proven methodology extraction capabilities through two experiments
- Ready for third domain (code review)

### 3. Agent Reusability for Code Review
Several inherited agents are directly applicable to code review:
- `agent-quality-gate-installer` → Linting rules, static analysis tools
- `agent-audit-executor` → Code consistency audits, style checks
- `agent-documentation-enhancer` → Code comment quality improvements
- `error-classifier` + `recovery-advisor` → Issue categorization and fix recommendations
- `agent-validation-builder` → Test coverage and validation logic review
- `coder` → Write review automation scripts, linting rules

### 4. Incremental Specialization
- Start with 15 agents (large foundation)
- Create NEW code review agents only when inherited agents insufficient
- Expected: 0-4 new agents (vs 5-8 if starting from scratch)
- Likely new agents:
  - `code-reviewer` (core review execution)
  - `security-scanner` (vulnerability detection)
  - `style-checker` (style guide enforcement)
  - `best-practice-advisor` (idiom and pattern recommendations)

## Adaptation Strategy

### Meta-Agent Adaptation
1. **Read existing capability files** before each iteration
2. **Adapt patterns** from CI/CD domain to code review domain
3. **Keep core capabilities stable** (observe, plan, execute, reflect, evolve)
4. **Specialize orchestrator** if needed (api-design-orchestrator → code-review-orchestrator)

### Agent Adaptation
1. **Try inherited agents first** before creating new ones
2. **Document adaptation** when using inherited agent in new context
3. **Create new agent** only when no inherited agent can fulfill need
4. **Justify creation** with clear gap analysis

**Adaptation Examples**:
- `agent-quality-gate-installer`: CI quality gates → Linting rules + pre-commit hooks
- `agent-audit-executor`: API consistency → Code consistency (naming, structure, patterns)
- `error-classifier`: CI errors → Code issues (bugs, smells, anti-patterns)
- `data-analyst`: Build metrics → Code metrics (complexity, coverage, churn)

---

## Expected Evolution Pattern

### Iteration 0
- **Verify inherited state** (all 15 agents + 6 capabilities)
- **Assess applicability** of inherited agents to code review domain
- **Identify reuse candidates** (quality-gate-installer, audit-executor, error-classifier)
- **Analyze target codebase** (internal/ package, ~15,000 lines)

### Iterations 1-N
- **Prefer inherited agents** for tasks
- **Adapt agent prompts** contextually for code review
- **Create new agents** only when justified:
  - No inherited agent can handle task
  - Clear gap in capabilities (e.g., security scanning, Go-specific idioms)
  - Significant efficiency gain expected

### Expected Final State (A_N)
- **Inherited agents retained**: 15 (all from A₀)
- **New code review agents**: 0-4 (only if needed)
- **Total agents**: 15-19
- **Comparison**: If starting from scratch, expected 8-12 agents total

## Code Review Domain Mapping

### From CI/CD Domain → Code Review Domain

**Quality Gates**:
- CI/CD: Pipeline stages must pass (build, test, lint)
- Code Review: Code must pass (linters, static analysis, security scans, style checks)
- **Agent**: `agent-quality-gate-installer` (directly applicable)

**Consistency Checks**:
- CI/CD: Workflow consistency across repos
- Code Review: Code consistency (naming, structure, patterns)
- **Agent**: `agent-audit-executor` (directly applicable)

**Error Detection**:
- CI/CD: Build failures, test failures
- Code Review: Bugs, anti-patterns, vulnerabilities
- **Agent**: `error-classifier` + `recovery-advisor` (directly applicable)

**Documentation Quality**:
- CI/CD: Workflow documentation, runbooks
- Code Review: Code comments, godoc, READMEs
- **Agent**: `agent-documentation-enhancer` (directly applicable)

**Automation**:
- CI/CD: Automated builds, tests, deployments
- Code Review: Automated linting, static analysis, style checking
- **Agent**: `coder` (directly applicable)

**Metrics Analysis**:
- CI/CD: Build times, success rates, pipeline efficiency
- Code Review: Complexity, coverage, churn, issue density
- **Agent**: `data-analyst` (directly applicable)
