# Experiment Plan: Bootstrap-008 Code Review Methodology

**Experiment ID**: bootstrap-008-code-review
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: READY TO START

---

## Executive Summary

**Objective**: Develop comprehensive code review methodology through observation of agent review patterns on meta-cc's internal/ package.

**Approach**: Apply Bootstrapped Software Engineering with dual-layer value optimization:
- **Instance Layer**: Agents perform systematic code review of ~15,000 lines of Go code
- **Meta Layer**: Meta-Agent observes review patterns and extracts transferable methodology

**Innovation**: First experiment to inherit from CI/CD domain (Bootstrap-007) and apply to code quality domain, demonstrating cross-domain methodology transfer.

**Expected Duration**: 4-6 iterations
**Expected Agents**: 15 (inherited) + 0-4 (new specialized)

---

## Methodological Framework

### Three-Methodology Integration

This experiment integrates:

1. **Empirical Methodology Development** (OCA Framework)
   - **Observe**: Analyze codebase, identify issues, review manually
   - **Codify**: Document review patterns, create checklists, build taxonomies
   - **Automate**: Implement linting rules, static analysis, automated checks

2. **Bootstrapped Software Engineering** (Three-Tuple Iteration)
   - State: sᵢ = {codebase_state, review_coverage, methodology_maturity}
   - Agents: Aᵢ = {review agents, analysis agents, automation agents}
   - Meta-Agent: Mᵢ = {observe, plan, execute, reflect, evolve}
   - Iteration: (Mᵢ, Aᵢ) = Mᵢ₋₁(T, Aᵢ₋₁)
   - Convergence: ‖Mₙ - Mₙ₋₁‖ < ε ∧ ‖Aₙ - Aₙ₋₁‖ < ε

3. **Value Space Optimization** (Dual Value Functions)
   - Instance gradient: A(s) ≈ ∇V_instance(s) (improve review quality)
   - Meta gradient: M(s, A) ≈ ∇²V_meta(s) (improve methodology)

## Value Functions (Dual Layer)

### Instance Value Function: V_instance(s)

Measures **code review quality**:

```
V_instance(s) = 0.3·V_issue_detection(s) +
                0.3·V_false_positive(s) +
                0.2·V_actionability(s) +
                0.2·V_learning(s)
```

**Component Definitions**:

1. **V_issue_detection** (Issue Finding Rate):
   ```
   V_issue_detection = issues_found / total_actual_issues

   Calculation:
   - issues_found: Count of real issues identified by review
   - total_actual_issues: Estimated from:
     * Historical bug rate (6.06% error rate from session data)
     * Code complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity)
     * Test coverage gaps (target 80%, current 70-85%)
     * Known issue categories (bugs, smells, anti-patterns, security)

   Target: ≥0.70 (70% recall)
   Baseline: 0.30 (30% from manual ad-hoc reviews)
   ```

2. **V_false_positive** (Precision):
   ```
   V_false_positive = 1 - (false_positives / total_issues_reported)

   Calculation:
   - false_positives: Issues flagged but not real problems
   - total_issues_reported: All issues identified by review

   Target: ≥0.80 (≤20% false positive rate)
   Baseline: 0.70 (30% false positives in manual reviews)
   ```

3. **V_actionability** (Recommendation Quality):
   ```
   V_actionability = actionable_recommendations / total_recommendations

   Calculation:
   - actionable_recommendations: Clear, concrete, implementable fixes
   - total_recommendations: All improvement suggestions

   Criteria for actionability:
   - Specific (not vague "improve code quality")
   - Implementable (clear steps to fix)
   - Justified (explains why change is needed)
   - Prioritized (indicates importance)

   Target: ≥0.80 (80% actionable)
   Baseline: 0.50 (50% actionable in manual reviews)
   ```

4. **V_learning** (Team Learning Value):
   ```
   V_learning = patterns_documented / patterns_identified

   Calculation:
   - patterns_documented: Patterns captured in knowledge base
   - patterns_identified: All patterns observed during review

   Pattern categories:
   - Anti-patterns (what to avoid)
   - Best practices (what to follow)
   - Idioms (language-specific patterns)
   - Design patterns (architectural patterns)

   Target: ≥0.75 (75% documentation rate)
   Baseline: 0.20 (20% documentation in manual reviews)
   ```

**Composite Target**: V_instance(s_N) ≥ 0.80

### Meta Value Function: V_meta(s)

Measures **methodology quality**:

```
V_meta(s) = 0.4·V_methodology_completeness(s) +
            0.3·V_methodology_effectiveness(s) +
            0.3·V_methodology_reusability(s)
```

**Component Definitions**:

1. **V_methodology_completeness** (Documentation Coverage):
   ```
   V_completeness = documented_patterns / total_patterns

   Required methodology components:
   - Review process framework (observation → analysis → reporting)
   - Issue classification taxonomy (bugs, smells, security, etc.)
   - Review decision criteria (when to flag, when to ignore)
   - Automation strategies (what to automate, how)
   - Tool selection guidelines (linters, static analyzers)
   - Prioritization frameworks (severity, impact)

   Target: ≥0.90 (90% coverage)
   Baseline: 0.00 (no methodology yet)
   ```

2. **V_methodology_effectiveness** (Efficiency Improvement):
   ```
   V_effectiveness = 1 - (review_time_with_methodology / review_time_baseline)

   Measurement:
   - Baseline: Manual ad-hoc review time (~8-10 hours for 15K lines)
   - With methodology: Systematic review time (target: ≤2 hours)
   - Transfer test: Apply to cmd/ package (~5K lines)

   Target: ≥0.80 (80% time reduction = 5x speedup)
   Baseline: 0.00 (no methodology yet)
   ```

3. **V_methodology_reusability** (Transferability):
   ```
   V_reusability = successful_transfers / transfer_attempts

   Transfer tests:
   - Internal transfer: Apply to cmd/ package (different domain)
   - External transfer: Apply to other Go projects (validation)

   Success criteria:
   - Methodology applies without modification: 100% success
   - Methodology needs minor adaptation: 80% success
   - Methodology needs major adaptation: 50% success
   - Methodology doesn't apply: 0% success

   Target: ≥0.70 (70% success rate across Go projects)
   Baseline: 0.00 (no methodology yet)
   ```

**Composite Target**: V_meta(s_N) ≥ 0.80

  - Generic agents insufficient for comprehensive review
- Focus: Review parser/ and analyzer/ modules

**Iteration 2** (Pattern Identification):
- M₂: M₁ (likely unchanged)
- A₂: A₁ (likely unchanged, reuse code-reviewer)
- Focus: Review query/ and validation/ modules, identify patterns

**Iteration 3** (Issue Taxonomy):
- M₃: M₂ (likely unchanged)
- A₃: A₂ + **security-scanner** (new, if security issues found)
  - Rationale: Need specialized security analysis (gosec, etc.)
- Focus: Build issue taxonomy, document review patterns

**Iteration 4** (Methodology Codification):
- M₄: M₃ (likely unchanged)
- A₄: A₃ + **style-checker** (new, if style consistency needed)
  - Rationale: Enforce style guide beyond gofmt
- Focus: Create review checklist, decision frameworks

**Iteration 5** (Automation):
- M₅: M₄ (likely unchanged)
- A₅: A₄ + **best-practice-advisor** (new, if Go idioms important)

- Focus: Implement linting rules, configure tools

**Iteration 6** (Transfer & Convergence):
- M₆: M₅ (unchanged, convergence)
- A₆: A₅ (unchanged, convergence)
- Focus: Transfer test to cmd/ package, validate methodology

**Note**: This is an expected path, not a prescription. Actual evolution determined by:
- Agent performance on tasks
- Gap analysis from reflect phase
- Value function improvements
- Methodology maturity

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Inherited Agents Insufficient

**Risk**: 15 inherited agents may not cover code review needs

**Mitigation**:
- Start with inherited agents (proven reusability)
- Create new agents incrementally based on actual gaps
- Expected: 0-4 new agents (code-reviewer, security-scanner, style-checker, best-practice-advisor)
- Justification required for each new agent

### Risk 2: Large Codebase Scope

**Risk**: 15,000 lines may be too large for single experiment

**Mitigation**:
- Modular approach: Review one module per iteration
- Focus on representative modules first (parser, analyzer)
- Scale methodology to remaining modules
- Transfer test on smaller codebase (cmd/ package)

### Risk 3: Subjective Review Quality

**Risk**: Code review quality is subjective, hard to measure

**Mitigation**:
- Define objective metrics (issue count, false positives, actionability)
- Use historical data for baselines (6.06% error rate)
- Validate with transfer tests (cmd/ package)
- Document measurement methodology clearly

### Risk 4: Methodology Over-Specialization

**Risk**: Methodology too specific to meta-cc, not reusable

**Mitigation**:
- Focus on universal patterns (applicable to Go in general)
- Abstract domain-specific patterns
- Test transferability explicitly (cmd/ package + hypothetical projects)
- Target: ≥70% reusability across Go projects

### Risk 5: Automation Complexity

**Risk**: Linting/static analysis configuration too complex

**Mitigation**:
- Use existing tools (golangci-lint, staticcheck, gosec)
- Start with standard configurations
- Customize incrementally based on review findings
- Prefer configuration over custom tooling
