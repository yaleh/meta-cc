# Insights

insights:
  successful:
    - "Config package created with zero test failures (TDD success)"
    - "Comprehensive validation prevents runtime config errors"
    - "Backward compatibility maintains MCP server compatibility"
    - "Foundation laid for future centralization"

  challenges:
    - "Time/token budget insufficient for full iteration scope"
    - "Underestimated implementation time (500 LOC took full session)"
    - "Need to prioritize smaller, focused iterations"

  learnings:
    - "Foundation work (config, patterns) is valuable even if not immediately applied"
    - "Comprehensive tests (12 test functions, 100% coverage) provide confidence"
    - "Defer complex work (linters) to dedicated iterations"
    - "Partial iteration completion is acceptable with clear deferral plan"

# Next Iteration Focus

next_iteration:
  iteration: 4
  primary_goal: "Apply configuration, standardize error handling"
  objectives:
    - "Migrate MCP server to use internal/config"
    - "Migrate cmd/ to use internal/config"
    - "Standardize 50+ error sites with sentinel errors"
    - "Add logging to internal/parser/ and internal/query/"
    - "Consider linter-generator agent for automated enforcement"

  expected_delta_v:
    instance: +0.15  # From applying config + error standardization
    meta: +0.10  # From validating patterns work in practice

  prerequisites:
    - "Config package (✓ complete)"
    - "Error handling conventions (✓ from Iteration 2)"
    - "Logging conventions (✓ from Iteration 1)"

# Convergence Assessment

convergence:
  status: NOT_CONVERGED
  criteria:
    meta_stable: true  # M3 = M2
    agent_stable: true  # A3 = A2
    instance_value_met: false  # 0.465 < 0.80
    meta_value_met: false  # 0.455 < 0.80
    objectives_complete: false  # Only 25% of work done

  estimated_iterations_remaining: 3-4
  rationale:
    - "Foundation work complete (config package)"
    - "Implementation work deferred to Iteration 4"
    - "Linter work may require Iteration 5"
    - "System stable, no agent evolution needed"
    - "Methodology validated through implementation"

# Summary

summary: |
  Iteration 3 achieved partial completion, focusing on creating the centralized
  configuration package as a foundation for future work. The config package is
  production-ready with 100% test coverage and comprehensive validation.

  Work was deferred due to time/token constraints, but this is acceptable as:
  1. Foundation is solid (config package complete and tested)
  2. Methodology is validated (TDD worked, patterns are sound)
  3. Clear plan exists for Iteration 4 (apply config, standardize errors)
  4. System remains stable (no premature evolution)

  Value improvements are modest (+3.3% instance, +13.8% meta) but represent
  important groundwork that will enable larger gains in Iteration 4 when the
  config package is actually applied throughout the codebase.
