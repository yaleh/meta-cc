  complexity_assessment:
    use_implementation_difficulty: "MEDIUM"
    rationale:
      - "Pattern documented (use-metrics-pattern.md provides templates)"
      - "Prometheus integration exists (metrics.go extends easily)"
      - "Runtime APIs well-known (runtime.NumGoroutine, runtime.ReadMemStats, /proc)"
      - "Atomic operations available (sync/atomic for queue counters)"
    estimated_time: "2-3 hours"

      utilization: "cpu_utilization_percent (0-100%)"
      collection: "Read /proc/{pid}/stat (utime + stime)"

expected_value_increase:
  V_coverage:
    current: 0.60
    expected: 0.75
    delta: +0.15
    rationale: "USE metrics add resource coverage (40% → 75%)"

  V_actionability:
    current: 0.75
    expected: 0.80
    delta: +0.05
    rationale: "Saturation metrics enable capacity planning"

  V_performance:
    current: 0.90
    expected: 0.88
    delta: -0.02
    rationale: "Additional metrics add ~1% overhead (still acceptable)"

  V_consistency:
    current: 0.90
    expected: 0.92
    delta: +0.02
    rationale: "USE pattern completes observability stack"

  V_instance_s5_expected:
    value: 0.82
    delta: +0.03
    percentage: "+3.8%"
    convergence: "LIKELY (exceeds 0.80 threshold)"

  V_completeness:
    current: 0.50
    expected: 0.60
    delta: +0.10
    rationale: "4.0 patterns validated (Logging + RED + USE + partial tracing awareness)"

  V_effectiveness:
    current: 0.60
    expected: 0.68
    delta: +0.08
    rationale: "USE methodology validated through implementation"

  V_reusability:
    current: 0.65
    expected: 0.70
    delta: +0.05
    rationale: "USE pattern transferability reinforced"

  V_meta_s5_expected:

    delta: +0.07
    percentage: "+12.1%"
    convergence: "PROGRESSING (81% of target)"

priority_observations:
  1_instance_convergence_achievable:
    priority: "CRITICAL"
    observation: "V_instance can reach 0.82 with USE completion (exceeds 0.80 target)"
    evidence: "Only -0.01 gap in iteration 4, USE adds +0.03"

  2_meta_progress_significant:
    priority: "HIGH"
    observation: "USE validation advances meta layer by +0.07 (to 81% of target)"
    evidence: "Completes second major methodology (RED + USE = 2 of 3 core patterns)"

  3_implementation_straightforward:
    priority: "MEDIUM"
    observation: "USE implementation is extension of iteration 4 work"
    evidence: "metrics.go exists, patterns documented, 8 metrics to add"
