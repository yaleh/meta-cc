# Assessment Summary

**Current State**: Minimal observability (almost no logging, no metrics, no tracing)

**Key Findings**:
- Only 1 fmt.Printf statement found (effectively no logging)
- 300 error handling points without logging
- No structured logging framework
- No metrics instrumentation
- No distributed tracing
- No operational dashboards
- No alerting rules

**Impact**:
- **Diagnostic Time**: Hours to diagnose issues (manual code inspection required)
- **Performance Visibility**: None (cannot measure latency, throughput, errors)
- **Operational Awareness**: Blind (no real-time visibility)

**Recommendation**: Start with structured logging (Iteration 1), then metrics (Iteration 2), then tracing (Iteration 3)
