tracing_implementation:
  trace_hierarchy:
    root_span:
      name: jsonrpc.request
      attributes:
        - rpc.method (initialize, tools/list, tools/call)
        - rpc.jsonrpc.version (2.0)
      creation: handleRequest() function
      lifecycle: Created at request start, ended at request completion

    child_span:
      name: tool.execute
      parent: jsonrpc.request
      attributes:
        - tool.name (query_tools, query_user_messages, etc.)
        - output.length (bytes)
        - duration.ms (milliseconds)
        - error.type (validation_error, io_error, etc.) [on error]
      creation: handleToolsCall() function
      lifecycle: Created before tool execution, ended after completion

  trace_context_propagation:
    method: W3C Trace Context (via OpenTelemetry SDK)
    mechanism: Go context.Context
    flow:
      - handleRequest() creates root span with context
      - Context passed to handleInitialize(), handleToolsList(), handleToolsCall()
      - handleToolsCall() creates child span from parent context
      - Trace IDs extracted and added to logs at each step

  trace_log_correlation:
    implementation: Extract trace ID from context and add to slog statements
    log_fields_added:
      - trace_id: W3C Trace ID (32 hex chars)
      - span_id: W3C Span ID (16 hex chars)
    coverage: ALL log statements in request and tool execution paths
    benefit: Correlate logs with traces for unified debugging

  span_status_tracking:
    success:
      status: codes.Ok
      message: "success"
      attributes: output.length, duration.ms

    error:
      status: codes.Error
      message: Error message text
      attributes: error.type
      error_recording: span.RecordError(err)

  sampling_strategy:
    default: AlwaysSample (development/testing)
    production_option: TraceIDRatioBased (configurable)
    configuration: OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG environment variable
    example: OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG=0.1 for 10% sampling

build_and_test:
  build_status: PASSED
  build_command: go build ./cmd/mcp-server/
  test_status: EXISTING_FAILURE (pre-existing, unrelated to tracing)
  test_failure: capabilities_integration_test.go (nil pointer dereference)
  regression_introduced: false
  tracing_impact: None (failure in unchanged code)

  log_statements_updated: ~10 (added trace_id/span_id fields)

integration_benefits:
  trace_to_logs:
    mechanism: trace_id in log statements
    workflow: "Trace shows request flow → trace_id in logs → filter logs by trace_id"
    benefit: "Unified debugging (trace timeline + log details)"

  trace_to_metrics:
    mechanism: "Same tool name, error type tags"
    workflow: "Metrics show high error rate → trace shows failing requests → identify pattern"
    benefit: "Symptom (metrics) → diagnosis (trace) → root cause (logs)"

  logs_to_metrics:
    mechanism: "Structured logging fields match metric labels"
    workflow: "Logs show errors → metrics aggregate error counts → alerting"
    benefit: "Individual events (logs) → trends (metrics) → proactive alerting"

expected_value_impact:
  V_coverage:
    from: 0.80
    to: 0.81
    delta: +0.01
    reason: "Tracing adds request flow visibility (minor coverage increase)"

  V_actionability:
    from: 0.85
    to: 0.87
    delta: +0.02
    reason: "Trace-log correlation enables faster diagnosis"

  V_performance:
    from: 0.88
    to: 0.88
    delta: 0
    reason: "AlwaysSample overhead negligible (< 1%), production sampling reduces further"

  V_consistency:
    from: 0.92
    to: 0.92
    delta: 0
    reason: "OpenTelemetry standard followed, consistent with logging/metrics patterns"

  V_completeness:
    from: 0.67
    to: 0.83
    delta: +0.16
    reason: "5 of 6 patterns validated (Logging + RED + USE + Tracing + partial dashboards)"

  V_effectiveness:
    from: 0.75
    to: 0.83
    delta: +0.08
    reason: "Tracing methodology validated through OpenTelemetry implementation"

  V_reusability:
    from: 0.75
    to: 0.83
    delta: +0.08
    reason: "OpenTelemetry patterns universally transferable (W3C standard)"

    delta: +0.11
    calculation: "(0.83 + 0.83 + 0.83) / 3 = 0.83"

next_steps:
  - Document distributed tracing pattern in knowledge/patterns/
  - Calculate actual V_instance(s₆), V_meta(s₆)
  - Validate convergence (V_meta ≥ 0.80 expected)
  - Generate iteration-6.md report
