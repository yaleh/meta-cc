performance_characteristics:
  overhead_estimated: "< 2%"
  metrics_collection_mechanism:
    - "Atomic operations (prometheus/client_golang)"
    - "Lock-free counters and gauges"
    - "Pre-allocated histogram buckets"
  resource_monitoring:
    - "Background goroutine (10-second interval)"
    - "runtime.ReadMemStats() for memory"
    - "runtime.NumGoroutine() for goroutines"

validation:
  build_status: "PASSED"
  test_status: "PASSED (all existing tests)"
  compilation: "SUCCESS"
  runtime_testing: "NOT YET (requires deployment with Prometheus scraper)"

observability_enhancements:
  before:
    - "Logging only (51 log statements, 40% coverage)"
    - "No metrics"
    - "No aggregated time-series data"
    - "Reactive debugging (logs after incidents)"

  after:
    - "Logging + Metrics"
    - "7 metrics (5 RED + 2 USE)"
    - "1027 time series"
    - "Proactive monitoring (metrics + alerts)"
    - "Request-level observability (rate, errors, latency)"

next_steps:
  immediate:
    - "Test metrics endpoint (implement /metrics HTTP handler)"
    - "Deploy with Prometheus scraper"
    - "Create Grafana RED dashboard"
    - "Configure alerting rules (error rate > 5%, p95 latency > 5s)"

  future:
    - "Complete USE metrics (CPU, file descriptors, queue depth)"
    - "Implement distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)"
    - "Add custom business metrics (query complexity, cache hit rate)"

lessons_learned:
  technical:
    - "Prometheus client_golang is easy to integrate"
    - "Cardinality control requires careful label design"
    - "Histogram buckets must match expected latency distribution"
    - "Atomic operations ensure minimal overhead"

  methodology:
    - "RED methodology maps perfectly to request-driven services"
    - "Instrumentation points should cover request lifecycle (start, end, error)"
    - "Metrics complement logs (metrics for trends, logs for details)"
    - "Design-first approach (iteration 3) accelerated implementation"
