# Strategy Decision for Iteration 0

**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Phase**: Strategy Formation

## Objective

Determine which documentation deliverable to create first in Iteration 0 and plan the approach.

## Deliverable Options

### Option A: README.md Plugin Installation Updates
**Description**: Update README.md to clarify plugin installation and skills availability

**Pros**:
- High visibility (README is entry point)
- Relatively small scope
- Quick to implement
- Existing text is already functional

**Cons**:
- Lower impact (current text works reasonably well)
- Not addressing critical gap
- Limited learning for methodology development

**Effort**: Low (1-2 hours)
**Impact**: Medium

### Option B: BAIME Usage Guide (docs/tutorials/baime-usage.md)
**Description**: Create comprehensive tutorial for using BAIME framework

**Pros**:
- Addresses critical gap (guide completely missing)
- High user value (key feature)
- Complex enough to generate methodology insights
- Will reveal documentation patterns
- Multiple sections to organize and write

**Cons**:
- Larger scope
- Requires understanding BAIME deeply
- More time investment

**Effort**: High (4-6 hours)
**Impact**: Very High

## Decision

**Selected**: Option B - BAIME Usage Guide

**Rationale**:

1. **Gap Criticality**: BAIME guide is completely missing while README installation text exists and is functional

2. **Methodology Learning**: Creating a comprehensive guide will reveal more documentation patterns than a minor update would. This aligns with Iteration 0's goal of establishing baseline and identifying problems.

3. **Value Function Impact**:
   - **Completeness**: Addresses major gap (high impact)
   - **Usability**: Complex guide will test clarity, navigation, examples (more learning)
   - **Maintainability**: Larger document will reveal organization challenges

4. **Honest Assessment**: A substantial deliverable allows for more meaningful baseline measurement. A small README update might artificially inflate baseline scores.

5. **User Impact**: BAIME is a key differentiator for meta-cc. Users can't effectively use it without a guide.

## Approach for BAIME Usage Guide

### Target Audience
Primary: Methodology practitioners who want to use BAIME for their projects

### Content Structure (Planned)

1. **Introduction**
   - What is BAIME?
   - When to use BAIME?
   - Key concepts overview

2. **Prerequisites and Setup**
   - Requirements
   - Directory structure
   - Initial files

3. **Core Concepts**
   - Iterations and convergence
   - Meta-agent and agents
   - Capabilities
   - Dual value functions

4. **Step-by-Step Workflow**
   - Setting up an experiment
   - Running Iteration 0
   - Executing subsequent iterations
   - Assessing convergence

5. **Practical Example**
   - Real-world example walkthrough
   - Expected outputs
   - Common patterns

6. **Agent Reference**
   - Meta-agent usage
   - Specialized agents
   - When to use each

7. **Troubleshooting**
   - Common issues
   - Debugging tips

8. **Next Steps**
   - Further reading
   - Advanced topics

### Quality Criteria for Iteration 0

**"Good Enough" Definition**:
- Document exists with all major sections
- Core concepts explained (even if not perfect)
- At least one concrete example
- Basic navigation (headers, links)
- Examples are technically accurate (tested)

**Acceptable Gaps for Iteration 0**:
- Advanced topics may be missing
- Some sections may be brief
- Troubleshooting may be incomplete
- Examples may not cover all scenarios
- Prose may not be perfectly polished

**Not Acceptable**:
- Broken links
- Incorrect installation commands
- Missing critical concepts
- No examples
- Confusing organization

### Implementation Plan

**Step 1**: Review BAIME skill structure
- Read `.claude/skills/baime-methodology-development/`
- Understand agent system
- Note key concepts

**Step 2**: Create document outline
- Define all major sections
- Plan content flow
- Identify examples needed

**Step 3**: Write core sections
- Introduction and concepts
- Setup instructions
- Basic workflow

**Step 4**: Add practical example
- Choose simple but realistic example
- Walk through complete iteration
- Include code/files

**Step 5**: Write supporting sections
- Agent reference
- Troubleshooting
- Next steps

**Step 6**: Manual validation
- Test all commands/examples
- Check all links
- Review for clarity

### Success Metrics (Iteration 0 Baseline)

**Minimum Viable**:
- Document created and committed
- All major sections present
- At least one tested example
- Links checked manually
- Readable by target audience

**Measurement Approach**:
- Test installation/setup steps myself
- Verify example can be followed
- Check links manually
- Assess against value function rubrics

## Alternative Considered: Hybrid Approach

**Rejected**: Do both README updates AND minimal BAIME guide

**Reasoning**: Better to do one thing well than two things poorly. For Iteration 0 baseline, depth is more valuable than breadth for methodology learning.

## Time Allocation

**Estimated Effort**:
- Research BAIME structure: 1 hour
- Outline and planning: 0.5 hours
- Writing content: 2-3 hours
- Examples and testing: 1 hour
- Review and validation: 0.5 hours
- **Total**: 5-6 hours

**Iteration 0 Total Budget**: ~8-10 hours including all phases

## Risk Assessment

**Risks**:
1. **Scope creep**: Guide becomes too comprehensive
   - **Mitigation**: Stick to "good enough" criteria, defer advanced topics

2. **BAIME complexity**: May be too complex to explain well in one iteration
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on basic usage, link to skill files for details

3. **Time overrun**: May take longer than estimated
   - **Mitigation**: Timeboxed to 6 hours max, accept incomplete if needed

4. **Example selection**: May choose poor example
   - **Mitigation**: Use simple, realistic example from experiments/

## Notes

This decision follows BAIME principles:
- ✅ Evidence-based: Based on gap analysis data
- ✅ Focused: One deliverable, not scattered effort
- ✅ Measurable: Clear success criteria
- ✅ Realistic: Scoped appropriately for Iteration 0
- ✅ Honest: Acknowledges this is baseline, not final product

The selected approach will generate valuable data about:
- Documentation writing challenges
- Organization patterns
- Example creation needs
- Navigation requirements
- Validation approaches

This data will inform methodology development in subsequent iterations.
