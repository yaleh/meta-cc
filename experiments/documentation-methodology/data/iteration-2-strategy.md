# Iteration 2 Strategy

**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Experiment**: Documentation Methodology Development

---

## Context from Iteration 1

**Current State**:
- V_instance_1 = 0.70 (gap to target: -0.10)
- V_meta_1 = 0.55 (gap to target: -0.25)
- System stable (2 iterations, no evolution)
- 1 pattern validated (progressive disclosure)
- 3 templates created
- 1 automation tool created (link validator)

**Iteration 1 Performance**:
- Instance layer: +0.04 (underperformed target by -0.05)
- Meta layer: +0.19 (exceeded target by +0.03)
- **Imbalance**: Heavy meta focus, insufficient instance improvements

**Key Learning**: Should balance meta and instance layer work. FAQ would have been 30 min for +0.05 impact.

---

## Iteration 2 Objectives

### Instance Layer (Primary Focus)

**Target**: V_instance_2 = 0.80 (∆ +0.10 from 0.70)

**Critical Improvements** (Must Address):

1. **Add FAQ Section** (Priority 1)
   - Effort: 30-45 minutes
   - Impact: +0.03 Completeness, +0.02 Usability = **+0.05 total**
   - Rationale: High ROI, addresses user accessibility
   - Questions to include:
     - What is BAIME? (answered, but FAQ provides quick access)
     - When should I use BAIME vs other approaches?
     - How long does an iteration typically take?
     - What if my value scores aren't improving?
     - Can I use BAIME for [specific domain]?
     - How do I know when to create a specialized agent?
     - What's the difference between capabilities and agents?
     - Do I need meta-cc plugin to use BAIME?

2. **Break Up Dense Sections** (Priority 2)
   - Effort: 1 hour
   - Impact: +0.03 Usability = **+0.03 total**
   - Rationale: Improves readability and learning experience
   - Sections to improve:
     - **Core Concepts** (currently 6 concepts in one section)
       - Split into: "Understanding Value Functions" and "The OCA Cycle"
       - Add subheadings for each concept
       - Add visual separators
     - **Step-by-Step Workflow** (currently 3 long phases)
       - Add subheadings for each step
       - Create visual flow indicators
       - Add "What you'll need" boxes

3. **Expand Troubleshooting Examples** (Priority 3)
   - Effort: 30 minutes
   - Impact: +0.02 Completeness = **+0.02 total**
   - Rationale: Addresses real user pain points
   - Add concrete examples to existing troubleshooting items:
     - Show example of "stuck" value scores with diagnosis
     - Demonstrate low transferability fix with before/after
     - Provide iteration count optimization example

**Total Instance Impact**: +0.10 (reaches convergence threshold!)

---

### Meta Layer (Secondary Focus)

**Target**: V_meta_2 = 0.70 (∆ +0.15 from 0.55)

**Critical Improvements** (Must Address):

1. **Create 2 More Templates** (Priority 1)
   - Effort: 2-3 hours
   - Impact: +0.10 Completeness, +0.05 Reusability = **+0.15 total**
   - Templates to create:
     - **Quick Reference Template** (~200 lines)
       - Structure: Command reference, common patterns, cheat sheet
       - Use case: API docs, CLI reference, checklists
       - Validation: Apply to BAIME quick reference section
     - **Troubleshooting Guide Template** (~200 lines)
       - Structure: Problem-Cause-Solution pattern
       - Use case: Debug guides, FAQ, support docs
       - Validation: Apply to BAIME troubleshooting section

2. **Create Command Verification Automation** (Priority 2)
   - Effort: 1-2 hours
   - Impact: +0.05 Completeness (automation), +0.05 Effectiveness = **+0.10 total**
   - Tool: `scripts/validate-commands.py`
   - Purpose: Verify code examples and command snippets are syntactically valid
   - Capabilities:
     - Extract code blocks from markdown
     - Validate bash syntax (shellcheck or basic parsing)
     - Check markdown formatting
     - Report issues with line numbers
   - Validation: Test on baime-usage.md

3. **Validate More Patterns** (Priority 3)
   - Effort: Integrated into template work
   - Impact: +0.05 Validation = **+0.05 total**
   - Approach: Use template creation work to validate patterns
   - Patterns to validate:
     - Example-driven explanation (use in quick reference template)
     - Problem-solution structure (use in troubleshooting template)

**Total Meta Impact**: +0.30 potential (realistic: +0.15 for convergence track)

---

## Strategic Priorities

### Balance Rationale

**Iteration 1**: 90% meta, 10% instance (imbalanced)
**Iteration 2**: 50% instance, 50% meta (balanced)

**Why Balance Matters**:
- Instance layer at 0.70, needs +0.10 to converge
- Meta layer at 0.55, needs +0.25 to converge (2 iterations at +0.15 pace)
- Instance can converge THIS iteration if properly prioritized
- Meta will converge in Iteration 3 with sustained progress

### High-ROI Quick Wins

**Instance Layer Quick Wins** (do first):
1. FAQ section (30 min, +0.05) - **Highest ROI**
2. Troubleshooting examples (30 min, +0.02)
3. Section breakup (1 hour, +0.03)

**Total: 2 hours for +0.10 instance improvement**

### Infrastructure Investment

**Meta Layer Infrastructure** (do second):
1. Quick reference template (1-1.5 hours, +0.08)
2. Troubleshooting template (1-1.5 hours, +0.07)
3. Command validation tool (1-2 hours, +0.10)

**Total: 4-5 hours for +0.15 meta improvement**

## Execution Plan

### Stage 1: Instance Layer Quick Wins (2 hours)

**1.1 Add FAQ Section** (30-45 min)
- Create FAQ section after "Quick Start"
- 8-10 high-value questions
- Link to detailed sections for deep dives
- Cross-reference with troubleshooting

**1.2 Expand Troubleshooting** (30 min)
- Add concrete examples to each troubleshooting item
- Show before/after for common issues
- Add diagnostic steps

**1.3 Break Up Dense Sections** (1 hour)
- Split Core Concepts into 2 sections
- Add subheadings to Step-by-Step Workflow
- Improve visual hierarchy

**Checkpoint**: V_instance should reach ~0.80

---

### Stage 2: Meta Layer Templates (2.5-3 hours)

**2.1 Create Quick Reference Template** (1-1.5 hours)
- Study existing quick reference patterns
- Create template structure
- Add guidelines and examples
- Validate by outlining BAIME quick reference

**2.2 Create Troubleshooting Template** (1-1.5 hours)
- Study problem-cause-solution pattern
- Create template structure
- Add quality checklist
- Validate against BAIME troubleshooting section

**Checkpoint**: 5 of 5 templates created

---

### Stage 3: Meta Layer Automation (1-2 hours)

**3.1 Create Command Validation Tool** (1-2 hours)
- Write `scripts/validate-commands.py`
- Extract code blocks from markdown
- Validate bash/shell syntax
- Test on baime-usage.md
- Document usage

**Checkpoint**: 2 of 3 automation tools created

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Instance Layer
- **V_instance_2**: 0.80 (∆ +0.10)
  - Accuracy: 0.75 (no change, already verified)
  - Completeness: 0.65 (+0.05 via FAQ and examples)
  - Usability: 0.75 (+0.10 via FAQ and section breakup)
  - Maintainability: 0.80 (no change, already automated)

### Meta Layer
- **V_meta_2**: 0.70 (∆ +0.15)
  - Completeness: 0.65 (+0.15 via 2 templates + 1 tool)
  - Effectiveness: 0.60 (+0.10 via automation tool)
  - Reusability: 0.75 (+0.10 via 2 more universal templates)
  - Validation: 0.60 (+0.05 via pattern validation through templates)

### Convergence Progress
- **Instance**: CONVERGED at 0.80 ✅
- **Meta**: Not yet (0.70, needs +0.10 in Iteration 3)
- **Trajectory**: Excellent - 1-2 iterations to full convergence

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Time Overrun on Template Creation

**Mitigation**:
- Time-box each template to 1.5 hours max
- If running over, complete structure and defer examples
- Templates are reusable - quality matters more than speed

### Risk: FAQ Questions Not User-Relevant

**Mitigation**:
- Base on Iteration 1 problems and gaps
- Include meta-cognitive questions (how to assess, when to evolve)
- Cross-reference with troubleshooting for validation

### Risk: Command Validation Tool Too Complex

**Mitigation**:
- Start with simple bash syntax checking
- Extract code blocks first (simpler problem)
- Validate basic syntax only (don't run commands)
- Use existing libraries (shellcheck if available)

---

## Success Criteria

**Minimum Success** (must achieve):
- V_instance_2 ≥ 0.78 (close to convergence)
- V_meta_2 ≥ 0.68 (steady progress)
- FAQ section complete (8+ questions)
- 5 of 5 templates created

**Target Success** (aim for):
- V_instance_2 = 0.80 (convergence!)
- V_meta_2 = 0.70 (+0.15 progress)
- All instance improvements complete
- 2 templates + 1 automation tool created

**Stretch Success** (if time permits):
- V_instance_2 > 0.82 (over-achievement)
- V_meta_2 > 0.72 (accelerated progress)
- Visual aids started (architecture diagram)
- Second domain example outlined

---

## Time Budget

**Total Estimated**: 6-7 hours

**Breakdown**:
- Stage 1 (Instance): 2 hours
- Stage 2 (Templates): 2.5-3 hours
- Stage 3 (Automation): 1-2 hours
- Evaluation and documentation: 1 hour

**Contingency**: 1 hour buffer for unexpected issues

---

## Pattern Validation Opportunities

This iteration will validate:

1. **Progressive Disclosure** (3rd use)
   - Apply to FAQ section structure
   - Apply to troubleshooting template

2. **Example-Driven Explanation** (2nd use)
   - Use in quick reference template
   - Demonstrates pattern reusability

3. **Problem-Solution Structure** (2nd use)
   - Core of troubleshooting template
   - Validates pattern across contexts

---

## Notes

**Key Insight from Iteration 1**: Quick wins (FAQ, section breakup) have high ROI but were deferred. Prioritize them in Iteration 2.

**Strategic Decision**: Focus 50% on instance layer to achieve convergence this iteration. This allows Iteration 3 to focus purely on meta layer final improvements.

**Documentation Quality**: Instance convergence this iteration will mean we have a production-ready BAIME guide by end of Iteration 2.

**Status**: Ready for execution
**Next**: Execute Stage 1 (Instance Layer Quick Wins)
