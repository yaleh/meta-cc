# Documentation Gaps Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Iteration**: 0

## Identified Gaps

### Critical Gap #1: Plugin Installation Instructions

**Current State**:
- README.md has plugin installation section (lines 27-58)
- Shows marketplace installation: `/plugin marketplace add yaleh/meta-cc` and `/plugin install meta-cc`
- Shows binary installation with curl one-liner
- Links to installation guide for other platforms
- Shows MCP server configuration
- Has verification steps

**Gap Analysis**:
The README includes basic plugin installation, but there's ambiguity:
1. **Skills Integration**: The README mentions "15 Validated Skills" are included, but doesn't explain:
   - What happens when you install the plugin
   - Where skills are located after installation
   - How to verify skills are available
   - Whether skills installation is automatic or requires additional steps

2. **Plugin vs Skills Distinction**: Users may not understand:
   - What is included in the plugin package
   - Difference between plugin commands, skills, and agents
   - How skills become available to Claude Code

3. **Complete Workflow**: Missing end-to-end flow:
   - Install plugin → Skills become available → How to use skills
   - Relationship between plugin installation and skill availability

**Severity**: Medium
**User Impact**: New users may not understand how to access the skills after plugin installation

### Critical Gap #2: BAIME Usage Guide

**Current State**:
- README mentions "Methodology Bootstrapping - BAIME framework (10-50x speedup, 100% success rate)"
- Links to Feature Overview which has brief description
- BAIME is available as a skill in `.claude/skills/baime-methodology-development/`
- No dedicated user-facing tutorial or guide

**Gap Analysis**:
1. **No Tutorial**: No docs/tutorials/baime-usage.md or similar
2. **How to Access**: Not clear how users invoke BAIME skill
3. **When to Use**: Missing guidance on when BAIME is appropriate
4. **Example Workflow**: No concrete example of using BAIME for a project
5. **Value Proposition**: Benefits stated but not demonstrated
6. **Prerequisites**: What knowledge/setup is needed?
7. **Agent System**: How to use specialized BAIME agents

**Severity**: High
**User Impact**: Users can't effectively use BAIME framework despite it being a key feature

### Secondary Gap #3: Skills Discovery and Usage

**Current State**:
- README lists 15 skills with brief descriptions
- Feature overview has more detail
- Each skill has README in .claude/skills/ directory

**Gap**:
- How do users invoke skills?
- Are skills available as subagents or through /meta command?
- How to discover which skill to use for which task?
- Examples of using each skill?

**Severity**: Medium
**User Impact**: Users know skills exist but may not know how to use them

### Secondary Gap #4: Agents Documentation

**Current State**:
- README mentions "5 Specialized Agents - Project planning, stage execution, iteration management"
- Agents exist in .claude/agents/
- No user guide for agents

**Gap**:
- How to invoke agents (@agent-name syntax?)
- When to use each agent
- Agent capabilities and workflows
- Examples of agent usage

**Severity**: Medium
**User Impact**: Users may not leverage agent capabilities effectively

## Gap Prioritization

### Must Address (Iteration 0)
1. **BAIME Usage Guide** - High impact, core feature
   - Create docs/tutorials/baime-usage.md
   - Include: What is BAIME, when to use, how to use, example workflow
   - Explain agent system and capabilities

### Should Address (Later Iterations)
2. **Plugin Installation Clarification** - Update README.md
   - Clarify what's included in plugin
   - Explain skills availability after installation
   - Add verification steps for skills

3. **Skills Usage Guide** - Create comprehensive guide
   - How to invoke skills
   - When to use each skill
   - Examples for each skill

4. **Agents Guide** - Document agent system
   - Agent invocation syntax
   - Agent capabilities
   - Usage examples

## User Journey Analysis

### New User Journey - Current Experience
1. User reads README → Sees BAIME mentioned
2. User installs plugin
3. User tries to use BAIME → **STUCK**: No guide on how to use it
4. User may browse .claude/skills/ directly → Not user-friendly

### New User Journey - Ideal Experience
1. User reads README → Sees BAIME with link to tutorial
2. User reads docs/tutorials/baime-usage.md → Understands what BAIME is, when to use it
3. User installs plugin
4. User follows tutorial example → Successfully uses BAIME
5. User refers back to guide as needed

## Target Audiences

### Audience #1: Methodology Users
- **Need**: Learn to use BAIME framework
- **Current Problem**: No tutorial or guide
- **Solution**: docs/tutorials/baime-usage.md

### Audience #2: New Plugin Users
- **Need**: Understand what they get with plugin installation
- **Current Problem**: Unclear skills availability
- **Solution**: Update README with clearer explanation

### Audience #3: Skill Users
- **Need**: Know how to invoke and use skills
- **Current Problem**: Skills listed but usage not explained
- **Solution**: Skills usage guide (future iteration)

## Measurement

### How to Measure Gap Closure

**BAIME Guide Success Criteria**:
- [ ] User can read guide and understand what BAIME is
- [ ] User can follow guide to set up BAIME experiment
- [ ] User can use BAIME agents and capabilities
- [ ] User can assess if BAIME is right for their use case
- [ ] Guide includes concrete example workflow

**Plugin Installation Success Criteria**:
- [ ] User knows what's included in plugin installation
- [ ] User can verify skills are available
- [ ] User understands relationship between plugin, skills, and agents

## Related Documentation

Existing docs that should link to new content:
- README.md → Link to BAIME tutorial
- docs/tutorials/installation.md → Mention skills availability
- docs/guides/integration.md → Reference skills and agents
- docs/reference/features.md → Link to detailed guides

## Notes

This gap analysis focuses on the two deliverables specified for Iteration 0:
1. README.md plugin installation updates (lower priority, current text is functional)
2. BAIME usage guide (higher priority, currently missing entirely)

Evidence shows that while meta-cc has excellent documentation coverage overall, there's a specific gap around BAIME usage that prevents users from leveraging this key framework effectively.
