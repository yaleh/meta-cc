- Agent descriptions match skill documentation
- OCA cycle correctly described

‚ö†Ô∏è **Not Fully Verified**:
- Agent invocation syntax assumed, not tested in running system
- Practical example is conceptual, not literally tested end-to-end
- **Impact**: Users may struggle with exact syntax details

‚úÖ **Links**:
- All 15 internal links checked and working
- No broken references
- All referenced files exist

‚úÖ **Up-to-Date**:
- Reflects current meta-cc plugin structure
- BAIME skill documentation is current

### Component 2: Effectiveness (0.0-1.0)

**Definition**: Problem resolution, efficiency gains, quality improvement

**Evidence**:

‚úÖ **Problem Resolution**:

**Problem #1**: BAIME usage guide missing entirely
- **Addressed**: ‚úÖ Yes - Guide now exists
- **Evidence**: docs/tutorials/baime-usage.md created
- **Quality**: Moderate (V_instance = 0.66)

**Other Problems**: Not addressed (README plugin installation not updated)

**Problem Resolution Rate**: 1/2 identified gaps (50%)

‚úÖ **Efficiency Gains**:

**Measured Efficiency**:

**Project-Agnostic Components**:
- Progressive disclosure structure: ‚úÖ Applies to any tutorial
- Example-driven explanation: ‚úÖ Universal documentation pattern
- Multi-level content: ‚úÖ Applicable to complex topics generally
- Cross-linking: ‚úÖ Standard documentation practice
- **Count**: 5/5 patterns have cross-project potential

‚ö†Ô∏è **Adaptation Effort**:

**To Apply to Another Tutorial**:
- Patterns identified: ‚úÖ Can reference
- Structure template: ‚ùå Not extracted (would need to reverse-engineer from example)
- Reusable components: ‚ùå None packaged for reuse
- **Estimated Effort**: Moderate (3-4 hours to adapt patterns)

**To Apply to Different Domain** (e.g., API documentation):
- Core patterns still apply: ‚úÖ (progressive disclosure, examples, etc.)
- But specific structure might differ: ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Estimated Effort**: Moderate-High (4-6 hours to adapt)

‚ùå **Domain Independence**:

**Methodology Components**:
- Lifecycle phases (needs ‚Üí strategy ‚Üí write ‚Üí validate): ‚úÖ Domain-independent
- Patterns identified: ‚úÖ Universal documentation patterns
- Specific deliverable: ‚ùå Domain-specific (BAIME tutorial)

**Knowledge Captured**:
- Pattern descriptions: ‚úÖ In writing-observations.md
- Templates: ‚ùå Not created

**Documentation for Methodology**:
- How to apply patterns: ‚ùå Not documented
- When to use each pattern: ‚ùå Not specified
- Template for tutorial creation: ‚ùå Not provided
- Decision tree for structure: ‚ùå Not created

**Reusability Assessment**:
- Generalizability: 60% (patterns universal, deliverable specific)
- Adaptation effort: 40% (moderate effort, no templates to speed it up)
- Domain independence: 50% (methodology universal, deliverable specific)
- Clear guidance: 20% (patterns noted but not packaged for reuse)

**Score**: 0.40

**Justification**:
- Patterns identified are genuinely universal (progressive disclosure, examples, etc.)
- Lifecycle phases are domain-independent
- **Penalties**:
  - No templates or packaged components for reuse (-0.30)
  - Guidance for reuse not clear or documented (-0.20)
  - Would require moderate effort to adapt (-0.10)
- For baseline, reusability is moderate - patterns exist but not well-packaged

## V_meta_0 Calculation

**Formula**: V_meta = (Completeness + Effectiveness + Reusability + Validation) / 4

**Component Scores**:
- Completeness: 0.25
- Effectiveness: 0.35
- Reusability: 0.40
- Validation: 0.45

**V_meta_0 = (0.25 + 0.35 + 0.40 + 0.45) / 4 = 1.45 / 4 = 0.3625**

**Rounded**: **V_meta_0 = 0.36**

---

## Summary

### Final Scores

**V_instance_0 = 0.66** (Documentation quality for meta-cc)
**V_meta_0 = 0.36** (Methodology quality for reuse)

### Score Interpretation

**V_instance (0.66)**:
- **Above baseline expectation** (0.20-0.40 typical for Iteration 0)
- Guide is functional and usable, though with gaps
- Room for improvement in all components
- Exceeded expectations for baseline iteration

**V_meta (0.36)**:
- **Within baseline expectation** (0.15-0.30 typical, achieved 0.36)
- Methodology is in early stages
- Patterns identified but not extracted
- Good foundation but needs development
- Appropriate for Iteration 0

### Honest Assessment Notes

**Where Scores May Seem High**:
- V_instance Accuracy (0.70): Could argue for lower due to untested agent syntax
- **Justification**: Core concepts verified, only invocation details uncertain

**Where Scores May Seem Low**:
- V_meta Completeness (0.25): Might seem harsh for having lifecycle coverage
- **Justification**: No templates, no automation, patterns not extracted - significant gaps

**Overall Assessment Integrity**:
- ‚úÖ Scores based on concrete evidence
- ‚úÖ Disconfirming evidence sought (validation-results.md identified issues)
- ‚úÖ Gaps enumerated explicitly
- ‚úÖ Penalties justified for each deficiency
- ‚úÖ No inflation due to effort expended

### Gap Analysis

**Instance Layer Gaps** (prevent V_instance > 0.80):
1. Agent invocation syntax not verified
2. Only one example (testing) - need multiple domains
3. No FAQ based on real user questions
4. Dense sections need breaking up
5. No visual aids (diagrams)

**Meta Layer Gaps** (prevent V_meta > 0.80):
1. **Critical**: No templates extracted
2. **Critical**: No automation tools created
3. Patterns identified but not validated across multiple uses
4. Maintenance phase not addressed
5. No retrospective validation
6. Clear guidance for pattern reuse missing

### Baseline Appropriateness

These scores are **appropriate for Iteration 0**:
- Low scores expected and acceptable
- Purpose: Establish starting point for improvement
- Both layers show work to do (V < 0.80)
- Clear improvement trajectory visible
- Honest assessment enables meaningful iteration
