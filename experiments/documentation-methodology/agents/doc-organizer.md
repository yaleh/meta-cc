# Documentation Organizer Agent

## Purpose
Organize documentation structure, navigation, and information architecture.

## Status
**Iteration 0**: Initial placeholder - Will be populated based on empirical evidence from actual documentation work.

## Patterns
Currently empty. Organization patterns will be extracted from iteration work as evidence emerges.

## Note
This agent definition follows the BAIME principle: agent capabilities evolve based on retrospective evidence, not anticipatory design. Patterns will be added when:
- They solve actual problems encountered during organization work
- They recur 2-3 times across iterations
- Evidence demonstrates their effectiveness
