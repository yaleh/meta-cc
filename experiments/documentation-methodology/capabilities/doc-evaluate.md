# Evaluation Capability

## Purpose
Guide the meta-agent in evaluating documentation quality and methodology effectiveness using dual value functions.

## Status
**Iteration 0**: Initial placeholder - Will be populated based on empirical evidence from actual documentation work.

## Guidance
Currently empty. Patterns and guidance will be extracted from iteration work as evidence emerges.

## Note
This capability follows the BAIME principle: methodology components evolve based on retrospective evidence, not anticipatory design. Patterns will be added when:
- They recur 2-3 times across iterations
- Evidence demonstrates their effectiveness
- Improvement is quantifiable in value scores
