# Bootstrap-006 Inheritance Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Source**: Bootstrap-006 (API Design Methodology)
**Target**: Bootstrap-007 (CI/CD Pipeline Optimization)

---

## Overview

Bootstrap-007 starts with the **converged state** from Bootstrap-006, inheriting both Meta-Agent capabilities and the complete agent set. This represents a **transfer learning** approach where validated capabilities and agents are reused across domains.

---

## Inherited Components

### 1. Meta-Agent M₀ (6 Capability Files)

**Source**: `experiments/bootstrap-006-api-design/meta-agents/`
**Destination**: `experiments/bootstrap-007-cicd-pipeline/meta-agents/`

**Inherited Capabilities**:
- ✓ `observe.md` - Data collection, pattern discovery (validated)
- ✓ `plan.md` - Prioritization, agent selection (validated)
- ✓ `execute.md` - Agent coordination, task execution (validated)
- ✓ `reflect.md` - Value calculation, gap analysis (validated)
- ✓ `evolve.md` - Agent creation, methodology extraction (validated)
- ✓ `api-design-orchestrator.md` - Domain orchestration (adaptable to CI/CD)

**Status**: All files copied and ready for adaptation to CI/CD domain

### 2. Agent Set A₀ (15 Agents)

**Source**: `experiments/bootstrap-006-api-design/agents/`
**Destination**: `experiments/bootstrap-007-cicd-pipeline/agents/`

**Inherited Agents by Category**:

#### Generic Agents (3)
1. `data-analyst.md` - Analyze build data, CI metrics, release patterns
2. `doc-writer.md` - Document pipeline configurations and methodology
3. `coder.md` - Write workflow configs, scripts, automation

4. `doc-generator.md` - Generate structured documentation
5. `search-optimizer.md` - Optimize documentation search and navigation

#### From Bootstrap-003 (Error Recovery) (3)
6. `error-classifier.md` - Classify and categorize errors
7. `recovery-advisor.md` - Recommend recovery strategies
8. `root-cause-analyzer.md` - Analyze error root causes

#### From Bootstrap-006 (API Design) (7)
9. `agent-audit-executor.md` - Execute audits and consistency checks
10. `agent-documentation-enhancer.md` - Enhance documentation quality
11. `agent-parameter-categorizer.md` - Categorize and organize parameters
12. `agent-quality-gate-installer.md` - **Install and configure quality gates** ⭐
13. `agent-schema-refactorer.md` - Refactor schemas for consistency
14. `agent-validation-builder.md` - **Build validation logic** ⭐
15. `api-evolution-planner.md` - Plan evolution and versioning

**⭐ = Directly applicable to CI/CD domain**

## Rationale for Inheritance

### 1. Transfer Learning
- Validated capabilities from Bootstrap-006 provide proven foundation
- Meta-Agent capabilities are domain-agnostic (observe, plan, execute, reflect, evolve)
- Many agents have cross-domain applicability

### 2. Reduced Bootstrap Time
- No need to rediscover basic meta-agent structure
- Mature agent set provides immediate capabilities
- Focus effort on CI/CD-specific innovations

### 3. Agent Reusability
Several inherited agents are directly applicable to CI/CD:
- `agent-quality-gate-installer` → CI/CD quality gates
- `agent-validation-builder` → Pipeline validation
- `agent-audit-executor` → Pipeline consistency audits
- `error-classifier` + `recovery-advisor` → CI/CD error handling
- `coder` → GitHub Actions workflows

### 4. Incremental Specialization
- Start with 15 agents (large foundation)
- Create NEW CI/CD agents only when inherited agents insufficient
- Expected: 0-3 new agents (vs 4-7 if starting from scratch)

---

## Adaptation Strategy

### Meta-Agent Adaptation
1. **Read existing capability files** before each iteration
2. **Adapt patterns** from API design domain to CI/CD domain
3. **Keep core capabilities stable** (observe, plan, execute, reflect, evolve)
4. **Specialize orchestrator** if needed (api-design-orchestrator → ci-cd-orchestrator)

### Agent Adaptation
1. **Try inherited agents first** before creating new ones
2. **Document adaptation** when using inherited agent in new context
3. **Create new agent** only when no inherited agent can fulfill need
4. **Justify creation** with clear gap analysis

---

## Expected Evolution Pattern

### Iteration 0
- **Verify inherited state** (all 15 agents + 6 capabilities)
- **Assess applicability** of inherited agents to CI/CD domain
- **Identify reuse candidates** (quality-gate-installer, validation-builder, etc.)

### Iterations 1-N
- **Prefer inherited agents** for tasks
- **Adapt agent prompts** contextually for CI/CD
- **Create new agents** only when justified:
  - No inherited agent can handle task
  - Clear gap in capabilities
  - Significant efficiency gain expected

### Expected Final State (A_N)
- **Inherited agents retained**: 15 (all from A₀)
- **New CI/CD agents**: 0-3 (only if needed)
- **Total agents**: 15-18
- **Comparison**: If starting from scratch, expected 10-12 agents total

## Key Differences from Original Plan

### Original Plan (Before Inheritance)
- Start with M₀: 5 capabilities (create from scratch)
- Start with A₀: 3 generic agents (create from scratch)
- Expected to create 4-7 specialized CI/CD agents
- Total iterations: 5-7

### Updated Plan (With Inheritance)
- Start with M₀: 6 capabilities (inherited from Bootstrap-006)
- Start with A₀: 15 agents (3 generic + 12 specialized)
- Expected to create 0-3 NEW CI/CD agents (many needs covered by inherited agents)
- Total iterations: Potentially 3-5 (faster due to mature baseline)

## Benefits of Inheritance Approach

1. **Reduced Reinvention**: Don't rediscover meta-agent structure
2. **Proven Capabilities**: All inherited components validated through Bootstrap-006
3. **Agent Reusability**: Many inherited agents directly applicable to CI/CD
4. **Faster Convergence**: Start from mature baseline, not primitive state
5. **Cross-Domain Transfer**: Validates transferability of bootstrapping methodology
6. **Incremental Specialization**: Create only truly needed new agents
