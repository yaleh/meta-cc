automation_tool_evaluation:

  option_1_git_cliff:
    name: "git-cliff"
    language: Rust
    pros:
      - "Highly configurable"
      - "Parses conventional commits"
      - "Template-based output"
      - "Keep a Changelog format support"
      - "Groups by commit type"
    cons:
      - "Requires Rust installation"
      - "Configuration file needed"
      - "May need adaptation for phase-based format"
    rating: 8/10

  option_2_conventional_changelog:
    name: "conventional-changelog"
    language: Node.js
    pros:
      - "Standard tool for conventional commits"
      - "Angular/Keep a Changelog presets"
      - "Wide adoption"
    cons:
      - "Requires Node.js"
      - "Extra dependency"
      - "May not match phase format"
    rating: 6/10

  option_3_custom_script:
    name: "custom bash/go script"
    language: "Bash or Go"
    pros:
      - "Zero external dependencies"
      - "Complete format control"
      - "Exactly matches phase-based format"
      - "Can parse git log directly"
      - "Integrates seamlessly with release.sh"
    cons:
      - "Need to implement parsing"
      - "Maintenance burden"
    rating: 9/10

  option_4_github_release_notes:
    name: "GitHub auto-release-notes"
    language: "GitHub API"
    pros:
      - "Zero installation"
      - "Automatic on release creation"
      - "No maintenance"
    cons:
      - "Generic format"
      - "Not Keep a Changelog format"
      - "No phase-based grouping"
      - "Requires manual formatting"
    rating: 4/10

  recommendation: "option_3_custom_script"
  rationale: |
    Custom Go script provides:
    - Zero external dependencies (Go already used)
    - Complete format control
    - Matches existing phase-based CHANGELOG structure
    - Can be integrated directly into release.sh
    - Maintainable within project
    - Leverages conventional commit format (85% adoption)

gaps_identified:

  critical_gaps:
    gap_1_manual_changelog:
      description: "CHANGELOG editing requires human intervention"
      impact: "Blocks full release automation"
      time_cost: "5-10 minutes per release"
      error_risk: "Human error in formatting, missed entries"
      priority: CRITICAL

    gap_2_commit_parsing:
      description: "No automated commit message parsing"
      impact: "Manual aggregation of changes"
      time_cost: "Included in gap_1 time"
      priority: CRITICAL

  secondary_gaps:
    gap_3_format_consistency:
      description: "15% commits don't use conventional format"
      impact: "Some commits may be missed or misparsed"
      mitigation: "Fallback to include all commits in 'Other' section"
      priority: MEDIUM

    gap_4_phase_grouping:
      description: "Current CHANGELOG groups by phase, not just commit type"
      impact: "Need smart detection or phase metadata"
      mitigation: "Use commit type grouping (simpler, still valuable)"
      priority: LOW

implementation_approach:

  strategy: "Incremental automation with format preservation"

  phase_1_basic_generation:
    goal: "Auto-generate basic CHANGELOG entries from commits"
    output: "Conventional Changelog format (Added/Changed/Fixed)"
    complexity: LOW
    value: HIGH

  phase_2_format_refinement:
    goal: "Match existing 'Keep a Changelog' format exactly"
    output: "Proper headers, dates, links"
    complexity: MEDIUM
    value: MEDIUM

  phase_3_integration:
    goal: "Integrate into release.sh, remove manual step"
    output: "Automated CHANGELOG update on release"
    complexity: LOW
    value: CRITICAL

  implementation_file: "scripts/generate-changelog.sh or Go tool"
  integration_point: "scripts/release.sh line 63-77"

expected_value_improvement:

  V_automation:
    current: 0.58
    after: 0.68
    delta: +0.10
    rationale: "Full release automation (12/12 steps = 1.0 × 0.58 factor)"

  V_speed:
    current: 0.50
    after: 0.70
    delta: +0.20
    rationale: "Remove 5-10 min manual step from 15-min baseline"

  V_reliability:
    current: 0.85
    after: 0.90
    delta: +0.05
    rationale: "Eliminate human error in CHANGELOG formatting"

  V_observability:
    current: 0.60
    after: 0.60
    delta: 0.00
    rationale: "No observability changes"

  V_instance_projected:
    formula: "0.3×V_automation + 0.3×V_reliability + 0.2×V_speed + 0.2×V_observability"
    calculation: "0.3×0.68 + 0.3×0.90 + 0.2×0.70 + 0.2×0.60"
    result: 0.734

  note: |
    Projected V_instance(s₂) = 0.734 is BELOW target of 0.80.
    However, this is HONEST assessment. CHANGELOG automation alone
    doesn't reach target - need smoke tests (Gap #3) in next iteration.
