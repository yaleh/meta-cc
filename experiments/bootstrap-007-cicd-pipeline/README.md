# Experiment: Meta-Agent Bootstrapping for CI/CD Pipeline Optimization

**Experiment ID**: bootstrap-007-cicd-pipeline
**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: ⏳ READY TO START
**Framework**: Bootstrapped Software Engineering + Value Space Optimization

---

## Overview

This experiment demonstrates Meta-Agent/Agent bootstrapping for developing a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline methodology and automated deployment infrastructure. It applies the proven three-methodology framework to the DevOps automation domain, developing both concrete CI/CD pipelines and reusable pipeline construction methodology.

**Key Objective**: Develop complete CI/CD pipeline for meta-cc project while simultaneously extracting transferable pipeline construction methodology.

**Dual-Layer Architecture**:
- **Meta-Objective** (Methodology Layer): Extract reusable CI/CD pipeline construction methodology
- **Instance Objective** (Implementation Layer): Build production-ready CI/CD pipeline for meta-cc

---

## Methodological Foundation

This experiment applies three integrated methodologies:

1. **Empirical Methodology Development** ([docs/methodology/empirical-methodology-development.md](../../docs/methodology/empirical-methodology-development.md))
   - Observe → Codify → Automate (OCA) framework for pipeline patterns

2. **Bootstrapped Software Engineering** ([docs/methodology/bootstrapped-software-engineering.md](../../docs/methodology/bootstrapped-software-engineering.md))
   - Three-tuple iteration: (Mᵢ, Aᵢ) = Mᵢ₋₁(T, Aᵢ₋₁)
   - Convergence when ‖Mₙ - Mₙ₋₁‖ < ε and ‖Aₙ - Aₙ₋₁‖ < ε

3. **Value Space Optimization** ([docs/methodology/value-space-optimization.md](../../docs/methodology/value-space-optimization.md))
   - Agent as gradient: A(s) ≈ ∇V_instance(s) (build better pipelines)
   - Meta-Agent as Hessian: M(s, A) ≈ ∇²V_meta(s) (improve methodology)

## Task Definition

### Instance Task (CI/CD Pipeline Construction)

**Task T_instance**: Build complete CI/CD pipeline for meta-cc project

**Context**:
- Current state: Manual release process, basic Makefile, no automated CI
- Target infrastructure: GitHub Actions workflows, automated releases, quality gates
- Integration points: Git hooks, Makefile, release scripts

**Instance Value Function V_instance(s)**:
```
V_instance(s) = 0.3·V_automation(s) +       # Automation degree
                0.3·V_reliability(s) +      # Pipeline reliability
                0.2·V_speed(s) +            # Pipeline execution speed
                0.2·V_observability(s)      # Monitoring & feedback quality

Components:
  V_automation:    (automated_tasks / total_tasks)
  V_reliability:   (successful_builds / total_builds)
  V_speed:         1 - (build_time / baseline_time)
  V_observability: (instrumented_stages / total_stages)

```

**Success Metrics**:
- Automation coverage: ≥90% (build, test, lint, release automated)
- Pipeline reliability: ≥95% (green builds)
- Build time: ≤5 minutes (from trigger to artifact)
- Observability: 100% (all stages instrumented with logs/metrics)

### Meta Task (Methodology Development)

**Task T_meta**: Extract reusable CI/CD pipeline construction methodology

**Context**:
- Observe agent work on concrete pipeline construction
- Identify patterns in pipeline design decisions
- Codify methodology for future CI/CD projects

**Meta Value Function V_meta(s)**:
```
V_meta(s) = 0.4·V_methodology_completeness(s) +    # Documentation coverage
            0.3·V_methodology_effectiveness(s) +   # Efficiency improvement
            0.3·V_methodology_reusability(s)       # Transferability

Components:
  V_completeness:   (documented_patterns / total_patterns)
  V_effectiveness:  speedup_on_transfer_tests
  V_reusability:    successful_transfers / transfer_attempts

Target: V_meta(s_N) ≥ 0.80
```

## Initial State

**Inherited from Bootstrap-006**: This experiment starts with the converged state from Bootstrap-006 (API Design Methodology), inheriting both the Meta-Agent capabilities and the full agent set developed through that experiment.

### M₀: Meta-Agent (Inherited from Bootstrap-006)

**Architecture**: Modular capability files in `meta-agents/`

```yaml
M₀:
  version: 1.0 (from Bootstrap-006)
  architecture: modular
  capability_files:
    - observe.md       # Data collection, pattern discovery
    - plan.md          # Prioritization, agent selection
    - execute.md       # Agent coordination, task execution
    - reflect.md       # Value calculation, gap analysis
    - evolve.md        # Agent creation, methodology extraction
    - api-design-orchestrator.md  # Domain orchestration (adaptable)

  source: experiments/bootstrap-006-api-design/meta-agents/

  note: |
    These capabilities have been validated through Bootstrap-006 and are
    ready for adaptation to CI/CD domain. The api-design-orchestrator.md
    can be specialized for CI/CD pipeline orchestration if needed.
```

  note: |
    All 15 agents are available from the start. CI/CD-specific agents will be
    created as needed during iterations. Some inherited agents (especially from
    Bootstrap-006) may be directly useful for CI/CD tasks (e.g., quality-gate-
    installer for pipeline quality gates).
```
