## Objective

**Primary Goal**: Develop complete CI/CD pipeline for meta-cc while simultaneously extracting reusable pipeline construction methodology.

**Dual Objectives**:

1. **Instance Objective** (Concrete Pipeline):
   - Build production-ready CI/CD pipeline for meta-cc
   - Automate: build → test → lint → release → deploy
   - Implement quality gates and multi-platform support
   - Target: V_instance(s_N) ≥ 0.80

2. **Meta Objective** (Methodology Extraction):
   - Observe agents building the pipeline
   - Extract pipeline construction patterns
   - Codify reusable methodology
   - Target: V_meta(s_N) ≥ 0.80

**Why Two Layers**:
- Agents work on concrete pipeline (instance task)
- Meta-Agent observes agent work and extracts methodology (meta task)
- Result: Both working pipeline AND transferable methodology

---

## Two-Layer Architecture

### Layer 1: Instance (Concrete CI/CD Pipeline)

**What Agents Build**:
```
meta-cc CI/CD Pipeline
├── .github/workflows/
│   ├── ci.yml              # Build, test, lint on every push
│   ├── release.yml         # Automated release on tag push
│   ├── cross-platform.yml  # Multi-platform builds
│   └── quality-gates.yml   # Coverage, linting enforcement
├── Quality Gates
│   ├── Test coverage ≥80%
│   ├── Linting passes (golangci-lint)
│   ├── Cross-platform builds succeed
│   └── CHANGELOG updated
├── Deployment Strategy
│   ├── GitHub Releases (binaries, bundles)
│   ├── Plugin marketplace (auto-sync)
│   └── Version management (automated)
└── Monitoring
    ├── Build status badges
    ├── Coverage tracking
    └── Release metrics
```

**Agent Workflow**:
1. Analyze existing infrastructure (Makefile, scripts)
2. Design pipeline stages (build → test → release)
3. Implement GitHub Actions workflows
4. Define quality gates and thresholds
5. Create deployment automation
6. Add monitoring and observability

### Layer 2: Meta (Methodology Extraction)

**What Meta-Agent Extracts**:
```
CI/CD Pipeline Construction Methodology
├── Pipeline Design Patterns
│   ├── Stage organization principles
│   ├── Dependency management
│   ├── Parallel execution strategies
│   └── Caching optimization
├── Quality Gate Frameworks
│   ├── Threshold determination methods
│   ├── Gate sequencing strategies
│   ├── Failure handling policies
│   └── Override mechanisms
├── Deployment Strategies

## Value Functions

### Instance Value Function V_instance(s)

**Purpose**: Measure CI/CD pipeline quality for meta-cc

**Components**:
```
V_instance(s) = 0.3·V_automation(s) +       # Automation degree
                0.3·V_reliability(s) +      # Pipeline reliability
                0.2·V_speed(s) +            # Pipeline speed
                0.2·V_observability(s)      # Monitoring quality

V_automation(s) = automated_tasks / total_tasks
  Tasks: build, test, lint, cross-compile, version-bump, release, deploy, publish
  Calculation: count(automated) / count(total)
  Scale: [0, 1] where 1 = fully automated

V_reliability(s) = successful_builds / total_builds
  Measured: CI build success rate over last 30 days
  Scale: [0, 1] where 1 = 100% success rate
  Target: ≥0.95 (95% green builds)

V_speed(s) = 1 - (current_time / baseline_time)
  baseline_time: Manual release time (~15 min)
  current_time: Pipeline execution time
  Scale: [0, 1] where 1 = instant, 0 = same as baseline
  Target: ≤5 min (V_speed ≥ 0.67)

V_observability(s) = instrumented_stages / total_stages
  Instrumentation: logs, metrics, status reporting, alerts
  Scale: [0, 1] where 1 = all stages observable
  Target: 1.0 (100% instrumentation)

Target: V_instance(s_N) ≥ 0.80
```

**Baseline** (s₀):
- V_automation: 0.40 (build/test automated, release/deploy manual)
- V_reliability: 0.60 (estimate based on manual process)
- V_speed: 0.50 (manual ~15 min, target ≤5 min)
- V_observability: 0.30 (local logs only)
- **V_instance(s₀) = 0.3×0.40 + 0.3×0.60 + 0.2×0.50 + 0.2×0.30 = 0.46**

### Meta Value Function V_meta(s)

**Purpose**: Measure methodology quality for reuse

**Components**:
```
V_meta(s) = 0.4·V_completeness(s) +      # Methodology coverage
            0.3·V_effectiveness(s) +     # Efficiency improvement
            0.3·V_reusability(s)         # Transferability

V_completeness(s) = documented_patterns / identified_patterns
  Patterns: design decisions, quality gates, deployment strategies, etc.
  Calculation: count(documented) / count(identified_total)
  Scale: [0, 1] where 1 = all patterns documented
  Target: ≥0.90 (90% coverage)

V_effectiveness(s) = speedup_on_transfer
  Measured: iterations_from_scratch / iterations_with_methodology
  Example: If methodology reduces 7 iterations → 2, speedup = 7/2 = 3.5
  Normalized: min(speedup / target_speedup, 1.0) where target = 3.0x
  Scale: [0, 1] where 1 = 3x+ speedup

V_reusability(s) = successful_transfers / transfer_attempts
  Transfer tests: Apply methodology to 2-3 different project types
  Calculation: count(successful) / count(attempted)
  Scale: [0, 1] where 1 = 100% transfer success
  Target: ≥0.65 (65% reusability expected)

Target: V_meta(s_N) ≥ 0.80
```

**Baseline** (s₀):
- V_completeness: 0.00 (no methodology yet)
- V_effectiveness: 0.00 (nothing to test)
- V_reusability: 0.00 (nothing to transfer)
- **V_meta(s₀) = 0.00**

## Iteration Plan

### Iteration 0: Baseline Establishment

**Goal**: Understand current build infrastructure and establish baseline

**M₀ Actions**:
1. **Observe** (M₀.observe):
   - Read Makefile (192 lines, 22 targets)
   - Analyze scripts/release.sh (113 lines, 13 steps)
   - Review git hooks (scripts/install-hooks.sh)
   - Query CHANGELOG patterns (46 accesses)
   - Examine cross-platform build setup

2. **Plan** (M₀.plan):
   - Identify automation opportunities
   - Prioritize pipeline components
   - Determine quality gate needs

3. **Execute** (M₀.execute + generic agents):
   - Invoke data-analyst to analyze infrastructure
   - Invoke doc-writer to document baseline

4. **Reflect** (M₀.reflect):
   - Calculate V_instance(s₀) = 0.46
   - Calculate V_meta(s₀) = 0.00
   - Identify gaps and problems

**Expected Output**:
- `iteration-0.md` with baseline analysis
- `data/s0-infrastructure.yaml` (infrastructure state)
- `data/s0-metrics.json` (calculated values)

**Agent Evolution**: A₀ unchanged (generic sufficient for analysis)
**Meta-Agent Evolution**: M₀ unchanged (core capabilities sufficient)

---

### Subsequent Iterations: Guided by Meta-Agent

**Process**: Follow five-capability cycle:

1. **OBSERVE** (M.observe):
   - Read capability file: `meta-agents/observe.md`
   - Review previous iteration outputs
   - Identify new data needs (CI metrics, build logs)
   - Discover pipeline patterns (for methodology extraction)

2. **PLAN** (M.plan):
   - Read capability file: `meta-agents/plan.md`
   - Define iteration goal (e.g., "Implement CI workflow")
   - Assess agent sufficiency
   - Decide: Use existing agents OR create specialized agent?

3. **EXECUTE** (M.execute):
   - Read capability file: `meta-agents/execute.md`
   - **IF generic agents insufficient**:
     - Create specialized agent (e.g., `pipeline-designer`)
     - Write agent prompt file: `agents/pipeline-designer.md`
     - Update A: A_N = A_{N-1} ∪ {pipeline-designer}
   - Read agent prompt files before invocation
   - Invoke agents to build pipeline components
   - Observe agent work for methodology patterns

4. **REFLECT** (M.reflect):
   - Read capability file: `meta-agents/reflect.md`
   - Calculate V_instance(s_N) (pipeline quality)
   - Calculate V_meta(s_N) (methodology quality)
   - Evaluate: ΔV_instance = V(s_N) - V(s_{N-1})
   - Evaluate: ΔV_meta = V(s_N) - V(s_{N-1})
   - Identify remaining gaps

5. **EVOLVE** (M.evolve):
   - Read capability file: `meta-agents/evolve.md`
   - Extract methodology patterns from agent work
   - Update methodology documentation
   - Decide: Add new M capabilities? (rare)

**Convergence Check** (every iteration):
```yaml
convergence_criteria:
  meta_agent_stable:
    M_N == M_{N-1}: [Yes/No]
    
  agent_set_stable:
    A_N == A_{N-1}: [Yes/No]
    
  instance_value_threshold:
    V_instance(s_N) ≥ 0.80: [Yes/No]
    
  meta_value_threshold:
    V_meta(s_N) ≥ 0.80: [Yes/No]
    
  objectives_complete:
    pipeline_deployed: [Yes/No]
    methodology_documented: [Yes/No]
    all_complete: [Yes/No]

convergence: [CONVERGED / NOT_CONVERGED]
```

**IF CONVERGED**: Stop and proceed to results analysis
**IF NOT CONVERGED**: Continue to next iteration

## Agent Creation Criteria

**When to Create Specialized Agents**:

### Criterion 1: Task Complexity
Generic agents struggle with complex domain-specific tasks:
- Pipeline design requiring stage orchestration knowledge
- Quality gate definition requiring threshold expertise
- Deployment strategy requiring infrastructure understanding

**Example**: If generic `coder` cannot design effective CI workflow structure → create `pipeline-designer`

### Criterion 2: Repeated Patterns
Task appears multiple times with similar requirements:
- Multiple workflow files need consistent structure
- Quality gates need systematic threshold determination
- Deployment steps follow repeating patterns

**Example**: If defining quality gates for test, lint, coverage → create `quality-gate-definer`

### Criterion 3: Domain Knowledge
Task requires specialized CI/CD expertise:
- Understanding GitHub Actions syntax and best practices
- Knowledge of multi-platform build strategies
- Expertise in rollback/recovery procedures

**Example**: If deployment requires blue-green strategy → create `deployment-strategist`

### Expected NEW CI/CD-Specific Agents

**Starting Position**: 15 agents inherited from Bootstrap-006

**Expected NEW Agents** (only if inherited agents insufficient):

Based on analysis of inherited agents and CI/CD requirements, expect 0-3 NEW specialized agents:

**Potential NEW Candidates** (create only if needed):
- `pipeline-designer`: Design GitHub Actions workflows (if coder insufficient)
- `ci-orchestrator`: Orchestrate complex multi-stage pipelines (if api-design-orchestrator insufficient)
- `deployment-strategist`: Design deployment strategies (if api-evolution-planner insufficient)
- `rollback-planner`: Design rollback procedures (if recovery-advisor insufficient)

**Likely Agent Reuse** (from inherited 15):
- `agent-quality-gate-installer`: Directly applicable to CI/CD quality gates
- `agent-validation-builder`: Applicable to pipeline validation
- `agent-audit-executor`: Applicable to pipeline consistency audits
- `error-classifier` + `recovery-advisor`: Applicable to CI/CD error handling
- `coder`: For workflow configs and scripts
- `data-analyst`: For build metrics and CI data

**Note**: Don't predetermine. Let needs drive creation. With 15 inherited agents, many CI/CD tasks may be covered without creating new agents.
