# Principle: Enforcement Before Improvement

## Statement

Implement quality gates **before** reaching target thresholds to prevent regression while working toward improvement.

---

## Rationale

Quality gates serve two purposes:
1. **Enforcement**: Prevent quality from declining
2. **Motivation**: Provide clear target for improvement

Waiting until quality reaches the threshold before adding gates creates two problems:
1. **Risk of decline**: Quality may decrease while working toward threshold
2. **Missed opportunity**: No enforcement mechanism during improvement phase

By implementing gates early (even when current quality is below threshold), you:
- Lock in current baseline (prevent backsliding)
- Create clear target (threshold becomes visible goal)
- Enable incremental progress (each improvement moves toward target)

---

## Evidence

**From Bootstrap-007, Iteration 1**:

**Context**:
- Test coverage: 71.7%
- Target threshold: 80%
- Gap: -8.3 percentage points

**Decision**: Implement coverage gate anyway, set to fail if < 80%

**Implementation**:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Check coverage threshold
  run: |
    COVERAGE=$(go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/%//')
    THRESHOLD=80.0
    if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < $THRESHOLD" | bc -l) )); then
      echo "❌ ERROR: Coverage ${COVERAGE}% is below threshold ${THRESHOLD}%"
      exit 1
    fi
```

**Result**:
- Gate blocks CI when coverage drops
- Team adds tests to reach 80%
- Coverage increases from 71.7% → 80%+
- Gate prevents future regression below 80%

**Outcome**: Gate prevented decline during improvement phase, provided clear target, motivated test additions.

## Applications

### 1. Test Coverage
**Scenario**: Current coverage below target
**Action**: Set gate at target level now
**Effect**: Prevents decline, motivates improvement

### 2. Code Quality (Linting)
**Scenario**: High lint violation count
**Action**: Enable lint blocking now (even with current violations)
**Effect**: No new violations added, gradual cleanup

### 3. Performance Budgets
**Scenario**: Build time exceeds budget
**Action**: Set performance gate at budget now
**Effect**: Prevents further slowdown, motivates optimization

### 4. Technical Debt
**Scenario**: High complexity metrics
**Action**: Set complexity threshold now
**Effect**: No new complex code, refactor incrementally

### 5. Security Vulnerabilities
**Scenario**: Known vulnerabilities exist
**Action**: Block new vulnerabilities now
**Effect**: No new security issues, fix existing incrementally

---

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Hard Gate with Current Exception
```yaml
gate:
  threshold: target_value
  action: fail
  exceptions: [current_violations]  # Grandfather existing
```

**Example**: Set lint to block on new violations, allow existing violations

### Pattern 2: Soft Gate with Warning
```yaml
gate:
  threshold: target_value
  action: warn  # Don't block yet
  escalation: fail_after_date
```

**Example**: Warn for 2 weeks, then enforce

### Pattern 3: Ratcheting Gate
```yaml
gate:
  threshold: current_value  # Start at current level
  improvement_rate: +1% per week
  target: final_value
```

**Example**: Coverage gate at 71.7%, increase by 1% weekly until 80%

## Trade-offs

### Advantages
- ✅ Prevents regression during improvement
- ✅ Provides clear, visible target
- ✅ Motivates incremental progress
- ✅ Locks in gains immediately
- ✅ Creates accountability

### Disadvantages
- ⚠️ May temporarily block CI (if hard gate)
- ⚠️ Requires team buy-in
- ⚠️ May slow velocity initially

### Mitigation
- Use soft gates initially (warnings)
- Grandfather existing violations
- Provide clear improvement path
- Communicate rationale to team

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 1: Wait Until Perfect
**Description**: "Let's reach 80% coverage first, then add gate"
**Problem**: Quality may decline while improving, no enforcement during journey
**Better**: Add gate now, work toward threshold with protection

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 2: Set Gate at Current Level
**Description**: "Coverage is 71.7%, so set gate at 71.7%"
**Problem**: No aspirational target, locks in suboptimal state
**Better**: Set gate at target (80%), acknowledge current gap, work to close

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 3: No Gate Until Team Agrees
**Description**: "Wait for consensus before adding gate"
**Problem**: Quality degrades during discussion
**Better**: Add warning-level gate, discuss enforcement timeline
