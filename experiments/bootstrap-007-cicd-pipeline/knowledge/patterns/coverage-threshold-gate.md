# Pattern: Coverage Threshold Gate

**Category**: Pattern (Domain-Specific Solution)
**Domain**: CI/CD, Quality, Testing
**Source**: Bootstrap-007, Iteration 1
**Validation**: ✅ Operational in meta-cc
**Complexity**: Low
**Tags**: quality, testing, gates, coverage

---

## Problem

Code quality tends to decline over time as developers prioritize feature delivery over test coverage. Without automated enforcement:
- Test coverage gradually decreases
- New code ships without adequate tests
- Technical debt accumulates silently
- Quality issues only surface in production

**Need**: Automated mechanism to prevent test coverage regression and enforce minimum quality standards.

---

## Context

**When to use this pattern**:
- Projects with test suites that generate coverage reports
- CI/CD pipelines with automated builds
- Teams committed to maintaining quality thresholds
- Projects where test coverage is a key quality metric

**When NOT to use**:
- Projects without automated tests
- Early prototyping phases where quality gates slow iteration
- Projects where coverage metrics don't reflect actual quality
- Legacy codebases with very low coverage (use ratcheting pattern instead)

---

## Solution

Implement a CI pipeline step that fails the build if test coverage falls below a defined threshold.

### Architecture

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
jobs:
  test:
    steps:
      - name: Run tests with coverage
        run: go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...

      - name: Check coverage threshold
        run: |
          COVERAGE=$(go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/%//')
          THRESHOLD=80.0
          if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < $THRESHOLD" | bc -l) )); then
            echo "❌ ERROR: Coverage ${COVERAGE}% is below threshold ${THRESHOLD}%"
            exit 1
          else
            echo "✅ Coverage ${COVERAGE}% meets threshold ${THRESHOLD}%"
          fi
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Fail Fast**: Gate runs early in CI pipeline (after tests)
2. **Clear Messaging**: Error output shows current vs required coverage
3. **Exit Code**: Non-zero exit code blocks merge/deployment
4. **Language Agnostic**: Pattern applies to any language with coverage tools

---

## Implementation

### Go Implementation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/check-coverage.sh

COVERAGE=$(go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/%//')
THRESHOLD=80.0

if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < $THRESHOLD" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "❌ ERROR: Coverage ${COVERAGE}% is below threshold ${THRESHOLD}%"
  exit 1
else
  echo "✅ Coverage ${COVERAGE}% meets threshold ${THRESHOLD}%"
fi
```

### Python Implementation

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Check coverage threshold
  run: |
    coverage report | tail -1 | awk '{print $4}' | sed 's/%//' > coverage.txt
    COVERAGE=$(cat coverage.txt)
    if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < 80.0" | bc -l) )); then
      echo "❌ ERROR: Coverage ${COVERAGE}% is below 80%"
      exit 1
    fi
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Implementation

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Check coverage threshold
  run: |
    COVERAGE=$(npx nyc report --reporter=text-summary | grep "Lines" | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/%//')
    if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < 80.0" | bc -l) )); then
      echo "❌ ERROR: Coverage ${COVERAGE}% is below 80%"
      exit 1
    fi
```

## Consequences

### Advantages

✅ **Prevents Regression**: Coverage cannot decline below threshold
✅ **Automated Enforcement**: No manual review needed
✅ **Fast Feedback**: Developers learn immediately if coverage is insufficient
✅ **Clear Target**: Threshold provides explicit quality goal
✅ **Low Overhead**: Minimal CI time added (~1-2 seconds)
✅ **Language Agnostic**: Works with any coverage tool

### Disadvantages

⚠️ **Can Block Deployment**: Failed gate stops all progress until fixed
⚠️ **Coverage ≠ Quality**: High coverage doesn't guarantee good tests
⚠️ **May Encourage Gaming**: Developers might write low-value tests to pass gate
⚠️ **Friction for New Features**: Large new features may temporarily lower coverage
⚠️ **Threshold Debates**: Teams may argue over "correct" threshold value

### Trade-offs

| Aspect | Strict Gate (80%+) | Lenient Gate (60-70%) | No Gate |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Quality** | High | Medium | Variable |
| **Developer Friction** | High | Low | None |
| **Maintenance Burden** | Low | Low | High |
| **False Positives** | Rare | Very Rare | N/A |
| **Coverage Trend** | Stable/Increasing | Stable | Declining |

## Examples

### Example 1: Initial Implementation (Bootstrap-007)

**Context**: Coverage was 71.7%, target threshold 80%

**Decision**: Implement gate at 80% despite being below threshold

**Implementation**:
```yaml
- name: Check coverage threshold
  run: |
    COVERAGE=$(go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/%//')
    THRESHOLD=80.0
    if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < $THRESHOLD" | bc -l) )); then
      echo "❌ ERROR: Coverage ${COVERAGE}% is below threshold ${THRESHOLD}%"
      exit 1
    fi
```

**Result**:
- CI failed until team added tests
- Coverage increased from 71.7% → 80%+
- Gate prevented future regression

**Learning**: Enforce threshold BEFORE reaching it (see "Enforcement Before Improvement" principle)

### Example 2: Multi-Package Coverage

```bash
# Check coverage across multiple packages
TOTAL_COVERAGE=$(go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total | awk '{sum+=$3; count++} END {print sum/count}')
THRESHOLD=80.0

if (( $(echo "$TOTAL_COVERAGE < $THRESHOLD" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "❌ ERROR: Average coverage ${TOTAL_COVERAGE}% is below ${THRESHOLD}%"
  go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep -v "100.0%" | sort -k3 -n
  exit 1
fi
```

### Example 3: Differential Coverage (New Code Only)

```bash
# Only check coverage of changed files
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD | grep '\.go$')
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep -F "$CHANGED_FILES" > new_coverage.txt
NEW_COVERAGE=$(awk '{sum+=$3; count++} END {print sum/count}' new_coverage.txt)

if (( $(echo "$NEW_COVERAGE < 90.0" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "❌ ERROR: New code coverage ${NEW_COVERAGE}% is below 90%"
  exit 1
fi
```

---

## Variations

### Variation 1: Ratcheting Gate (Gradual Improvement)

**Use Case**: Legacy codebase with low coverage (e.g., 40%)

```bash
# Store current coverage as new baseline if it's higher
COVERAGE=$(go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/%//')
CURRENT_BASELINE=$(cat .coverage-baseline 2>/dev/null || echo "40.0")

if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < $CURRENT_BASELINE" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "❌ ERROR: Coverage declined from ${CURRENT_BASELINE}% to ${COVERAGE}%"
  exit 1
elif (( $(echo "$COVERAGE > $CURRENT_BASELINE" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "$COVERAGE" > .coverage-baseline
  echo "✅ Coverage improved to ${COVERAGE}% (was ${CURRENT_BASELINE}%)"
fi
```

**Effect**: Coverage can only increase, never decrease

### Variation 2: Warning-Only Gate (Soft Enforcement)

```bash
COVERAGE=$(go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/%//')
THRESHOLD=80.0

if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < $THRESHOLD" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "⚠️  WARNING: Coverage ${COVERAGE}% is below threshold ${THRESHOLD}%"
  # Don't exit 1 - allow build to continue
else
  echo "✅ Coverage ${COVERAGE}% meets threshold ${THRESHOLD}%"
fi
```

**Effect**: Visibility without blocking

### Variation 3: Package-Level Thresholds

```bash
# Different thresholds for different packages
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | while read line; do
  PACKAGE=$(echo "$line" | awk '{print $1}')
  COVERAGE=$(echo "$line" | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/%//')

  case "$PACKAGE" in
    *core*)    THRESHOLD=90.0 ;;  # Core code requires 90%
    *api*)     THRESHOLD=80.0 ;;  # API code requires 80%
    *utils*)   THRESHOLD=70.0 ;;  # Utils require 70%
    *)         THRESHOLD=60.0 ;;  # Everything else 60%
  esac

  if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < $THRESHOLD" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "❌ $PACKAGE: ${COVERAGE}% < ${THRESHOLD}%"
    exit 1
  fi
done
```
