# Bootstrap-002: Test Strategy Development

**Framework**: BAIME (Bootstrapped AI Methodology Engineering)
**Status**: IN PROGRESS (Re-execution with BAIME framework)
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Domain**: Software Testing Methodology

---

## Overview

This experiment applies the BAIME framework to develop a systematic testing methodology through observation of agent testing patterns in the meta-cc project. The experiment uses the complete three-layer architecture (bootstrapped-se + empirical-methodology + value-optimization) to achieve both task completion and methodology development.

**Previous execution**: Converged at V(s₄) = 0.848 in 5 iterations with 89% reusability
**This execution**: Re-implementing with explicit BAIME framework integration

---

## Objectives

### Meta-Objective (Methodology Development Layer)

**Develop systematic testing methodology through observation of agent testing patterns**

Apply BAIME's OCA cycle:
- **Observe**: Collect data on testing patterns, coverage evolution, test execution
- **Codify**: Extract patterns into reusable testing methodology
- **Automate**: Create tools and CI checks for testing enforcement

**Expected Output**: (O, Aₙ, Mₙ)
- O = Test strategy documentation and improved test coverage
- Aₙ = Converged agent set (generic or specialized)
- Mₙ = Meta-Agent M₀ (expected to remain stable)

### Instance Objective (Task Execution Layer)

**Improve test coverage and quality for meta-cc project**

**Target**: `internal/` and `cmd/` packages (~5,000 lines of Go code)

**Scope**:
- Achieve ≥80% test coverage across critical paths
- Implement systematic gap closure workflow
- Create integration test patterns with fixtures
- Establish quality gates (≥8/10 criteria)

**Deliverables**:
- Improved test suite with ≥80% coverage
- Integration test patterns with httptest mocking
- Coverage-driven gap closure workflow
- Automated quality gates

## Value Functions

### V_instance: Testing Implementation Quality

```
V_instance(s) = 0.35·V_coverage +          -- Test coverage breadth
                0.25·V_quality +           -- Test effectiveness
                0.20·V_maintainability +   -- Test code quality
                0.20·V_automation          -- CI integration
```

**Component Definitions**:

1. **V_coverage** (Coverage Breadth):
   - 1.0: ≥85% coverage, all critical paths covered
   - 0.8: ≥75% coverage, most critical paths covered
   - 0.6: ≥65% coverage, some gaps in critical paths
   - 0.4: ≥50% coverage, significant gaps
   - <0.4: <50% coverage, inadequate

2. **V_quality** (Test Effectiveness):
   - 1.0: High-value tests, fast execution, no flaky tests
   - 0.8: Good test coverage, acceptable speed, <5% flaky
   - 0.6: Adequate tests, some slow tests, <10% flaky
   - 0.4: Weak tests, slow execution, <20% flaky
   - <0.4: Poor test quality, >20% flaky

3. **V_maintainability** (Test Code Quality):
   - 1.0: DRY, fixtures, clear naming, excellent documentation
   - 0.8: Good patterns, some reuse, clear structure
   - 0.6: Acceptable structure, limited reuse
   - 0.4: Some duplication, unclear tests
   - <0.4: High duplication, poor structure

4. **V_automation** (CI Integration):
   - 1.0: Full CI integration, coverage gates, automatic reporting
   - 0.8: CI integration, manual coverage checks
   - 0.6: Basic CI, no coverage enforcement
   - 0.4: Manual testing only
   - <0.4: No automation

### V_meta: Testing Methodology Quality

```
V_meta(s) = 0.40·V_methodology_completeness +    -- Documentation quality
            0.30·V_methodology_effectiveness +   -- Practical impact
            0.30·V_methodology_reusability       -- Transferability
```

**Component Definitions** (Universal BAIME rubrics):

1. **V_methodology_completeness**:
   - 1.0: Complete process + criteria + examples + edge cases + rationale
   - 0.8: Complete workflow + criteria, missing examples/edge cases
   - 0.6: Step-by-step procedures, missing decision criteria
   - <0.6: Observational notes only, no structured process

2. **V_methodology_effectiveness**:
   - 1.0: >10x speedup vs ad-hoc, >50% quality improvement
   - 0.8: 5-10x speedup, 20-50% quality improvement
   - 0.6: 2-5x speedup, 10-20% quality improvement
   - <0.6: <2x speedup, no measurable quality gain

3. **V_methodology_reusability**:
   - 1.0: <15% modification needed, nearly universal
   - 0.8: 15-40% modification, minor tweaks
   - 0.6: 40-70% modification, some adaptation
   - <0.6: >70% modification, highly specialized

## Convergence Criteria

**Standard Dual Convergence** (expected pattern):

```
CONVERGED iff:
  1. V_instance(s_n) ≥ 0.80        -- Task quality threshold
  2. V_meta(s_n) ≥ 0.80            -- Methodology quality threshold
  3. M_n == M_{n-1}                -- Meta-Agent stable
  4. A_n == A_{n-1}                -- Agent set stable
  5. ΔV_instance < 0.02 (2+ iters) -- Instance convergence
  6. ΔV_meta < 0.02 (2+ iters)     -- Meta convergence
```

**Expected Iterations**: 4-6 (based on medium domain complexity)

**Alternative Convergence Patterns**:
- **Practical Convergence**: If quality evidence exceeds metrics (justified partial criteria)
- **Meta-Focused Convergence**: If V_meta ≥ 0.80 and methodology is primary value

## Data Sources

### Observation Tools (meta-cc MCP)

```bash
# Test coverage analysis
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -func=coverage.out

# File access patterns (identify high-value test targets)
meta-cc query-files --threshold 10

# Error patterns (guide test design)
meta-cc query-tools --status error

# Testing-related conversations
meta-cc query-user-messages --pattern "test|coverage|mock|fixture"

# Test execution patterns
meta-cc query-tool-sequences --pattern "Bash.*test"
```

### Baseline Metrics

Current state (to be measured in Iteration 0):
- Test coverage: TBD
- Test count: TBD
- Flaky test rate: TBD
- CI integration: TBD

---

## Expected Agents

Based on BAIME principles (let specialization emerge from data):

**Initial agents** (generic, from M₀):
- coder: Write test code
- data-analyst: Analyze coverage data
- doc-writer: Document test patterns

**Potential specialized agents** (create only if needed):
- coverage-analyzer: Deep coverage gap analysis
- fixture-designer: Design reusable test fixtures
- mock-generator: Generate HTTP mocks

**Decision criteria**: Create specialized agent only when:
- Generic agents insufficient (demonstrated over 2+ iterations)
- Specialization provides >2x efficiency gain
- Pattern will be reused across multiple files/modules

## Context Management

**Estimated Context Allocation** (BAIME framework):
- Observation: 30% (coverage analysis, gap identification)
- Codification: 40% (methodology documentation, pattern extraction)
- Automation: 20% (CI integration, tool creation)
- Reflection: 10% (value calculation, convergence assessment)

**Context Pressure Handling**:
- If usage >80%: Serialize state to `knowledge/`, split session
- If usage >50%: Use reference compression, link to files
- Target: Meta-Focused Convergence if context constrained

## Transferability Plan

**Expected Reusability**: 85-90% (based on previous execution)

**What Transfers**:
- Coverage-driven gap closure workflow (100%)
- Test pattern library (fixtures, mocks) (90%)
- Quality gate criteria (85%)
- CI/CD integration approach (80%)

**What Needs Adaptation**:
- Language-specific fixtures (Go → Python/JS)
- Test framework details (testing → pytest/jest)
- Coverage tool commands (go test → pytest-cov/nyc)

**Adaptation Effort**:
- Same language (Go): 5% modification
- Similar language (Go → Rust): 15% modification
- Different paradigm (Go → Python): 25% modification

## Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks**:
- Low test coverage baseline may require extensive work
- Flaky tests may require debugging infrastructure
- Integration test complexity for MCP server

**Mitigation**:
- Start with unit tests (easier, faster feedback)
- Use httptest for clean HTTP mocking
- Parallelize test execution where possible

**Methodology Risks**:
- Over-testing (diminishing returns)
- Under-testing (gaps in critical paths)

**Mitigation**:
- Use value function to guide decisions
- Focus on high-change, high-value files first
- Quality over quantity (effective tests, not just coverage)
