# Cross-Language Transfer Validation Experiment Proposal

**Parent Experiment**: Bootstrap-002 Test Strategy Development (BAIME v2.0)
**Status**: PROPOSED
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Expected Duration**: 5-8 hours
**Created**: 2025-10-18

---

## Overview

This proposal outlines an experiment to validate the cross-language transferability claims from Bootstrap-002, specifically testing the hypothesis that the test strategy methodology achieves **V_reusability = 0.80** when transferred from Go to Python with **25-35% adaptation effort**.

**Hypothesis from Bootstrap-002**:
> Python adaptation: 25-35% modification needed, V_reusability = 0.80 (achieves target)

This experiment will apply the complete test strategy methodology to a Python project and measure:
1. **Adaptation effort**: Actual % modification needed
2. **Effectiveness**: Speedup achieved (compared to 3.1x Go average)
3. **Workflow transferability**: % workflow changes required
4. **Pattern applicability**: Which patterns transfer vs. require adaptation

---

## Objectives

### Primary Objective

**Validate Go→Python transferability claim**

Measure actual adaptation effort and compare to predicted 25-35% range. Confirm V_reusability ≥ 0.80.

### Secondary Objectives

1. **Document Python-specific adaptations**: Create Python adaptation guide
2. **Identify universal vs language-specific patterns**: Refine transferability model
3. **Test BAIME cross-language methodology**: Validate framework for language transfers

---

## Experiment Design

### Target Python Project

**Selection Criteria**:
- Similar domain to meta-cc (CLI tool, data processing, or MCP server)
- Medium complexity (500-1,000 lines of Python code)
- Existing test infrastructure (pytest)
- Active development (not legacy)

**Candidate Projects** (in order of preference):

1. **Internal Python MCP Server** (if exists)
   - Best analogy to meta-cc
   - Similar patterns (JSON-RPC, data processing)
   - Controlled environment

2. **Open Source Python CLI Tool**
   - Examples: httpie, rich, typer-based tools
   - Well-documented, active
   - Community benefit

3. **Python Data Processing Library**
   - Examples: pandas-based tools, data parsers
   - Similar to meta-cc's parser/query components

**Recommended**: Create a small Python MCP server (200-300 lines) as controlled validation environment.

### Scope

**Target**:
- Python codebase: 500-1,000 lines
- Test codebase: 300-600 lines (target)
- Coverage target: 80% (same as Go)
- Duration: Single day (5-8 hours)

**Out of Scope**:
- Full BAIME iteration cycle (not developing new methodology)
- Multi-context validation within Python (focus on Go→Python transfer only)
- Production deployment

## Methodology Transfer Process

### Phase 1: Direct Application (Minimal Adaptation)

**Objective**: Test workflow and patterns with minimal changes

**Process**:
1. Read complete test strategy methodology (`knowledge/test-strategy-methodology-complete.md`)
2. Apply 8-step coverage-driven workflow directly
3. Attempt to use 8 test patterns with minimal syntax changes
4. Use automation tools with Python adaptations

**Expected**: Will identify what needs adaptation

### Phase 2: Python-Specific Adaptation

**Objective**: Adapt patterns and tools for Python idioms

**Process**:
1. Adapt pattern library for pytest framework
2. Modify coverage analyzer for pytest-cov
3. Update test generator for Python syntax
4. Adjust quality standards for Python conventions

**Expected**: 25-35% modification based on Bootstrap-002 estimate

### Phase 3: Validation Measurement

**Objective**: Measure adaptation effort and effectiveness

**Measurements**:

1. **Adaptation Effort**:
   - Workflow changes: % of 8-step workflow modified
   - Pattern modifications: % of 8 patterns requiring changes
   - Tool modifications: % of 3 tools requiring changes
   - Total adaptation: Weighted average

2. **Effectiveness**:
   - Time without methodology: Baseline (estimate)
   - Time with methodology: Measured
   - Speedup: Ratio
   - Coverage improvement: % gained

3. **Pattern Applicability**:
   - Universal patterns: Which patterns transfer unchanged?
   - Adapted patterns: Which patterns need minor tweaks?
   - Python-specific patterns: Which patterns need major changes?

## Expected Adaptations

### Workflow (8 steps)

**Predicted**: 0-10% modification (mostly unchanged)

| Step | Go Version | Python Version | Change |
|------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| 1. Baseline measurement | `go test -cover` | `pytest --cov` | Tool syntax |
| 2. Gap identification | Same process | Same process | No change |
| 3. Priority ranking | Same process | Same process | No change |
| 4. Pattern selection | Same process | Same process | No change |
| 5. Test implementation | Go syntax | Python syntax | Syntax only |
| 6. Coverage verification | `go tool cover` | `coverage report` | Tool syntax |
| 7. Quality assessment | Same criteria | Same criteria | No change |
| 8. Iteration planning | Same process | Same process | No change |

**Expected workflow adaptation**: ~5% (tool commands only)

### Pattern Library (8 patterns)

**Predicted**: 25-35% modification (syntax + idioms)

| Pattern | Go Implementation | Python Adaptation | Effort |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| 1. Unit Test | `func TestX(t *testing.T)` | `def test_x():` + `assert` | Low (10%) |
| 2. Table-Driven | `tests := []struct{...}` | `@pytest.mark.parametrize` | Medium (30%) |
| 3. Mock/Stub | `httptest`, interfaces | `unittest.mock`, `pytest-mock` | High (40%) |
| 4. Error Path | `if err != nil` | `with pytest.raises` | Medium (25%) |
| 5. Test Helper | Helper functions | Fixtures (`@pytest.fixture`) | Medium (35%) |
| 6. Dependency Injection | Interface injection | Dependency injection (similar) | Low (15%) |
| 7. CLI Command | `cobra` testing | `click`/`argparse` testing | Medium (30%) |
| 8. Integration Test | `httptest.NewServer` | `requests-mock`, `responses` | High (40%) |

**Expected pattern adaptation**: ~28% average

### Automation Tools (3 tools)

**Predicted**: 30-40% modification (different tools, syntax)

| Tool | Go Implementation | Python Adaptation | Effort |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Coverage Analyzer | Parse `go tool cover` | Parse `pytest --cov` | Medium (35%) |
| Test Generator | Generate Go syntax | Generate Python syntax | High (45%) |
| Comprehensive Guide | Go examples | Python examples | Medium (25%) |

**Expected tool adaptation**: ~35% average

### Overall Adaptation Estimate

**Weighted Calculation**:
- Workflow (0%): 5% × 0.0 (no weight to unchanged parts)
- Patterns (70%): 28% × 0.7 = 19.6%
- Tools (30%): 35% × 0.3 = 10.5%
- **Total**: ~30% (within 25-35% predicted range)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1**: Python project too different from meta-cc
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: High (invalidates comparison)
- **Mitigation**: Create controlled Python MCP server with similar patterns

**Risk 2**: Adaptation effort higher than expected (>35%)
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium (hypothesis not confirmed, but valuable data)
- **Mitigation**: Document reasons, refine model

**Risk 3**: Speedup lower than Go baseline (< 2.0x)
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Acceptable if methodology still provides value

### Methodological Risks

**Risk 1**: Confirmation bias (forcing data to fit hypothesis)
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Impact**: High (invalidates experiment)
- **Mitigation**: Honest measurement, document all deviations

**Risk 2**: Insufficient baseline (no "without methodology" comparison)
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium (can't measure speedup)
- **Mitigation**: Estimate baseline using Bootstrap-002 ratios

⚠️ **Warning**: < 5 patterns adapted OR > 40% average modification

### After 5 hours (Tool Adaptation)

✅ **Success**: All 3 tools functional with < 40% modification
⚠️ **Warning**: Tools require > 50% modification OR don't work

## Alternative Approaches

### Option A: Full BAIME Re-Execution (Not Recommended)

Apply complete BAIME framework to Python project from scratch

**Pros**: Most rigorous validation
**Cons**: 20-30 hours (too expensive for validation)

### Option B: Minimal Validation (Not Recommended)

Apply only 1-2 patterns to small Python module

**Pros**: Quick (1-2 hours)
**Cons**: Insufficient data to validate 25-35% claim

### Option C: Recommended Approach (Above)

Systematic transfer with measurement at each step

**Pros**: Balanced rigor and efficiency
**Cons**: Still requires 5-8 hours commitment
