  # Pattern-by-Pattern Breakdown
  patterns:
    - pattern: "Pattern 1: Unit Test"
      go_example: "func TestX(t *testing.T) {...}"
      python_example: "def test_x(): assert ..."
      adaptation_pct: 10
      rating: "LOW"
      changes:
        - "func Test → def test_"
        - "t.Fatalf → assert with message"
        - "t.Errorf → assert"

    - pattern: "Pattern 2: Table-Driven"
      go_example: "tests := []struct{...}"
      python_example: "@pytest.mark.parametrize"
      adaptation_pct: 30
      rating: "MEDIUM"
      changes:
        - "[]struct{} → @pytest.mark.parametrize decorator"
        - "t.Run(tt.name) → pytest handles naming"
        - "Tuple list instead of struct array"

    - pattern: "Pattern 3: Mock/Stub"
      go_example: "httptest, interface mocking"
      python_example: "unittest.mock, mock_open"
      adaptation_pct: 45  # Higher due to Path.exists() mocking issue discovered
      rating: "HIGH"
      changes:
        - "Interface-based mocking → unittest.mock"
        - "httptest → mock_open for file I/O"
        - "Additional Path.exists() mocking required"
        - "More extensive mocking needed"

    - pattern: "Pattern 4: Error Path"
      go_example: "if err != nil {...}"

      go_example: "Helper functions"
      python_example: "@pytest.fixture"
      adaptation_pct: 35
      rating: "MEDIUM"
      changes:
        - "Helper functions → @pytest.fixture decorator"
        - "Explicit setup → pytest lifecycle management"
        - "Different dependency injection approach"

    - pattern: "Pattern 8: Integration Test"
      go_example: "os.CreateTemp, defer cleanup"
      python_example: "tmp_path fixture"

# Key Findings
findings:
  successes:
    - "Workflow transferred with 0% changes (universal process)"
    - "Speedup 2.24x achieved (above 2.0x target)"
    - "Coverage 81% achieved (above 80% target)"
    - "Pattern adaptation 30% (within predicted 25-35% range)"
    - "All 19 tests passing (100% pass rate)"
    - "Test execution fast (0.16 sec)"

  challenges:
    - "Mock/stub pattern required more adaptation (45% vs 40% predicted)"
    - "Path.exists() mocking issue discovered (Python-specific challenge)"
    - "V_reusability 0.77 slightly below 0.80 target"
    - "More extensive mocking needed in Python vs Go interfaces"

  insights:
    - "Workflow universality confirmed across languages"
    - "Pattern concepts transfer well, syntax requires adaptation"
    - "Mocking/stubbing most challenging pattern (language paradigm differences)"
    - "pytest fixtures excellent analog to Go test helpers"
    - "@pytest.mark.parametrize excellent table-driven replacement"
    - "Error path testing cleaner with pytest.raises vs manual checks"

  recommendations:
    - "Add Python-specific mocking guidance to pattern library"
    - "Document Path.exists() and filesystem mocking patterns"
    - "Create pytest-specific pattern templates"
    - "Adjust V_reusability calculation to account for language paradigm shifts"
