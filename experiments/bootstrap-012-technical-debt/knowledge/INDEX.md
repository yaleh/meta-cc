# Knowledge Index - Bootstrap-012 Technical Debt Quantification

**Purpose**: Cumulative knowledge catalog extracted from technical debt experiment iterations.

**Organization**: Knowledge is categorized into patterns, principles, templates, best practices, and methodologies.

---

## Knowledge Categories

### Patterns (Domain-Specific)
Specific solutions to recurring problems in technical debt management.

*No patterns extracted yet (Iteration 0 is baseline establishment)*

### Principles (Universal)
Fundamental truths or rules discovered through debt measurement work.

*No principles extracted yet (Iteration 0 is baseline establishment)*

### Templates (Reusable)
Concrete implementations ready for reuse.

*No templates created yet (Iteration 0 is baseline establishment)*

### Best Practices (Context-Specific)
Recommended approaches for specific contexts.

*No best practices documented yet (Iteration 0 is baseline establishment)*

### Methodologies (Project-Wide)
Comprehensive guides for reuse across projects.

*No methodologies documented yet (Iteration 0 is baseline establishment)*

## Knowledge by Iteration

### Iteration 0 (Baseline - 2025-10-17)
**Focus**: Baseline establishment and codebase inventory

**Data collected**:
- Codebase inventory (12,759 production lines, 14 modules)
- Complexity metrics (86 functions >10 complexity, avg 5.4)
- Test coverage (78.1% overall, below 80% target)
- Code duplication (1 duplicate block, minimal)
- Static analysis (1 style warning)
- Debt hotspots (10 identified, 45 hours estimated debt)

**Observations** (not yet codified as knowledge):
- MCP command builders share complex argument processing patterns
- Query commands have similar filtering/processing patterns
- Parser expression handling has intentional similarity
- Test coverage lower in CLI commands (57.9%) vs internal modules (82-94%)
- Complexity concentrated in cmd/mcp-server and query commands

**Knowledge extraction status**: Pending (observations captured, patterns to be codified in future iterations)

## Knowledge Validation Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: Observed pattern, needs validation
2. **Validated**: Tested and confirmed in practice
3. **Refined**: Improved through additional iterations

---

## Notes

- Knowledge extraction begins in Iteration 1+ (observe-codify-automate cycle)
- Iteration 0 establishes baseline data for pattern recognition
- Methodology will emerge from systematic debt measurement work
