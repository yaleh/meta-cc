## Experiment Overview

This experiment develops a comprehensive technical debt quantification methodology through systematic observation of agent debt measurement patterns. The experiment operates on two independent layers:

1. **Instance Layer** (Agent Work): Quantify and prioritize technical debt in meta-cc codebase
2. **Meta Layer** (Meta-Agent Work): Extract reusable technical debt management methodology

---

## Two-Layer Objectives

### Meta-Objective (Meta-Agent Layer)

**Goal**: Develop technical debt quantification methodology through observation of agent debt measurement patterns

**Approach**:
- Observe how agents measure technical debt (complexity, duplication, coverage)
- Identify patterns in debt prioritization (value/effort ratio)
- Extract reusable methodology for technical debt management
- Document principles, patterns, and best practices
- Validate transferability across programming languages

**Deliverables**:
- Technical debt quantification methodology
- Debt prioritization framework
- Paydown strategy patterns
- Prevention guidelines
- Transfer validation (Go → other languages)

### Instance Objective (Agent Layer)

**Goal**: Quantify and prioritize technical debt in meta-cc codebase (~5,000 lines)

**Scope**: Measure debt (complexity, test coverage, duplication), create paydown plan

**Target Files**:
- `internal/` - Core modules (parser, analyzer, query)
- `cmd/` - CLI and MCP server
- All Go source files

**Deliverables**:
- Debt report (SQALE index, technical debt ratio)
- Prioritization matrix (value/effort ratio)
- Paydown roadmap (phased debt reduction)
- Prevention checklist
- Automated tracking system

## Value Functions

### Instance Value Function (Technical Debt Management Quality)

```
V_instance(s) = 0.3·V_measurement +      # Accurate debt quantification
                0.3·V_prioritization +   # Right debt addressed first
                0.2·V_tracking +         # Debt trends visible over time

## Domain Knowledge

### SQALE Model (Software Quality Assessment based on Lifecycle Expectations)

1. **Technical Debt Calculation**
   ```
   Technical Debt = Remediation Cost (hours)
   Technical Debt Ratio = Debt / Development Cost
   ```

2. **SQALE Rating**
   - A: Debt ratio ≤ 5%
   - B: 6-10%
   - C: 11-20%
   - D: 21-50%
   - E: >50%

3. **Code Smells** (SQALE taxonomy)
   - **Bloaters**: Long methods, large classes, long parameter lists
   - **OO Abusers**: Switch statements, refused bequest, alternative classes
   - **Change Preventers**: Divergent change, shotgun surgery, parallel inheritance
   - **Dispensables**: Comments, duplicate code, dead code, speculative generality
   - **Couplers**: Feature envy, inappropriate intimacy, message chains

### Debt Prioritization

1. **Value/Effort Matrix**
   ```
   Priority = Debt Value / Remediation Effort

   Value factors:
   - Velocity impact (developer hours saved)
   - Quality impact (bugs prevented)
   - Risk reduction (failure prevention)

   Effort factors:
   - Lines of code to change
   - Test coverage required
   - Risk of regression
   ```

2. **Prioritization Quadrants**
   - **High Value, Low Effort**: Address immediately (quick wins)
   - **High Value, High Effort**: Plan for future sprints
   - **Low Value, Low Effort**: Address opportunistically
   - **Low Value, High Effort**: Avoid or defer

### Go-Specific Debt Indicators

1. **Complexity Metrics**
   - Cyclomatic complexity >10 (gocyclo)
   - Cognitive complexity >15
   - Function length >50 lines
   - File length >500 lines

2. **Duplication Metrics**
   - Duplicate code blocks >50 tokens (dupl)
   - Copy-paste patterns

3. **Coverage Metrics**
   - Test coverage <80%
   - Untested critical paths
   - Missing integration tests

4. **Static Analysis Issues**
   - staticcheck warnings
   - go vet warnings
   - golangci-lint issues

## Synergy with Other Experiments

### Extends Completed Experiments

- **Bootstrap-004 (Refactoring)**: Provides measurement for refactoring decisions
- **Bootstrap-002 (Test Strategy)**: Low test coverage is debt indicator

### Complements Future Experiments

- **Bootstrap-005 (Performance)**: Technical debt often causes performance issues
- **Bootstrap-013 (Cross-Cutting)**: Inconsistent patterns indicate debt

---

## Expected Timeline

**Estimated Iterations**: 5-7 iterations (based on complexity)

**Iteration Pattern**:
- **Iteration 0**: Baseline establishment (current debt state)
- **Iterations 1-2**: Comprehensive debt measurement (Observe phase)
- **Iterations 3-4**: Debt prioritization and roadmap (Codify phase)
- **Iterations 5-6**: Tracking automation and prevention (Automate phase)
- **Iteration 7+**: Convergence and transfer validation (if needed)

**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 weeks (15-20 hours total)
