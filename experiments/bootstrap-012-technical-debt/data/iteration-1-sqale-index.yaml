# Codebase: meta-cc
# Methodology: SQALE (Software Quality Assessment based on Lifecycle Expectations)

sqale_analysis:
  codebase: "meta-cc"
  total_loc: 12759
  development_cost_hours: 425.3
  productivity_standard: "30 LOC/hour (SQALE)"

  technical_debt:
    complexity_debt: 54.5
    duplication_debt: 1.0
    coverage_debt: 10.0
    static_analysis_debt: 0.5
    total_debt: 66.0

  technical_debt_ratio: 15.52  # percentage
  sqale_rating: "C"  # Moderate (11-20%)

  rating_thresholds:
    A: "≤5% (Excellent)"
    B: "6-10% (Good)"
    C: "11-20% (Moderate)"  # ← Current rating
    D: "21-50% (Poor)"
    E: ">50% (Critical)"

  debt_by_characteristic:
    maintainability: 55.5  # complexity + duplication
    reliability: 10.5      # coverage + static analysis
    total: 66.0

  debt_breakdown_percentage:
    complexity: 82.6       # 54.5/66
    coverage: 15.2         # 10/66
    duplication: 1.5       # 1/66
    static_analysis: 0.7   # 0.5/66

  interpretation:
    status: "Moderate technical debt"
    primary_debt_source: "Complexity (82.6% of total debt)"
    secondary_debt_source: "Test coverage gaps (15.2% of total debt)"
    positive_indicators:
      - "Low duplication (1.5% of debt)"
      - "Very clean static analysis (0.7% of debt)"
      - "Good test coverage in most modules (78.1% overall)"
    concerns:
      - "High complexity concentration in MCP server and query commands"
      - "cmd package coverage below target (57.9% vs 80%)"
      - "25 functions exceed critical complexity threshold (>15)"

  comparison_to_industry:
    sqale_rating: "C (Moderate) - Average for mature projects"
    td_ratio: "15.52% - Within acceptable range (10-20%)"
    recommendation: "Paydown plan needed to improve to B rating (6-10%)"

remediation_targets:
  to_achieve_B_rating:
    target_td_ratio: 10.0   # Upper bound of B rating
    target_total_debt: 42.5  # 10% of 425.3 hours
    debt_reduction_needed: 23.5  # 66 - 42.5
    percentage_reduction: 35.6   # 23.5/66

  priority_areas:
    - area: "High-complexity functions (>20)"
      current_debt: 24.0
      potential_savings: 12.0  # Reduce to complexity 15
      impact: "50% reduction in high-complexity debt"

    - area: "cmd package test coverage"
      current_debt: 8.0
      potential_savings: 4.0  # Improve to 70%
      impact: "40% reduction in coverage debt"

    - area: "MCP builder consolidation"
      current_debt: 9.0  # 3 files with similar patterns
      potential_savings: 6.0  # Consolidate common logic
      impact: "67% reduction in MCP builder debt"
