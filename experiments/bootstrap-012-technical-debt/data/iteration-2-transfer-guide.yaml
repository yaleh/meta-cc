transfer_guide:
  overview:
    purpose: "Validate methodology reusability across languages and projects"
    approach: "Document language-specific adaptations needed"
    reusability_target: "≥80% methodology transferable without modification"
    effectiveness_target: "≥4x speedup vs manual debt analysis"

  universal_components:
    description: "Methodology components that work across all languages (no adaptation)"
    percentage: 85
    components:
      - component: "SQALE Index Calculation"
        reusability: 100
        reason: "Development cost = LOC / productivity (30 LOC/hour) is language-agnostic"
        adaptation_needed: "None"

      - component: "Technical Debt Ratio Formula"
        reusability: 100
        reason: "TD Ratio = Total Debt / Development Cost is universal"
        adaptation_needed: "None"

      - component: "SQALE Rating Thresholds"
        reusability: 100
        reason: "A-E ratings (≤5%, 6-10%, 11-20%, 21-50%, >50%) are industry standard"
        adaptation_needed: "None"

      - component: "Value-Effort Prioritization Matrix"
        reusability: 100
        reason: "Quadrants (High/Low Value × Low/High Effort) apply to any debt"
        adaptation_needed: "None"

      - component: "Paydown Roadmap Structure"
        reusability: 100
        reason: "Phase-based approach (Quick Wins → Strategic → Opportunistic) is universal"
        adaptation_needed: "None"

      - component: "SQALE Code Smell Taxonomy"
        reusability: 90
        reason: "Bloaters, Change Preventers, Dispensables, Couplers apply broadly"
        adaptation_needed: "Minor: Some smells language-specific (e.g., OO Abusers only for OO languages)"

      - component: "Remediation Cost Model Structure"
        reusability: 95
        reason: "Graduated cost model (low/med/high complexity → hours) applies broadly"
        adaptation_needed: "Minor: Calibrate threshold values per language"

      - component: "Test Coverage Debt Model"
        reusability: 100
        reason: "Coverage gap → remediation hours works for all languages with testing"
        adaptation_needed: "None (if language has testing framework)"

  language_specific_adaptations:
    description: "Adaptations needed per language (15% of methodology)"
    percentage: 15
    categories:
      - category: "Complexity Thresholds"
        adaptation_percentage: 5
        reason: "Complexity standards vary by language expressiveness"
        examples:
          python:
            current_go_threshold: 10
            python_threshold: 12
            rationale: "Python is more expressive; 12 is acceptable"
          javascript:
            current_go_threshold: 10
            javascript_threshold: 8
            rationale: "JS callback complexity; lower threshold"
          java:
            current_go_threshold: 10
            java_threshold: 10
            rationale: "Similar to Go"
          rust:
            current_go_threshold: 10
            rust_threshold: 15
            rationale: "Rust pattern matching adds complexity; higher threshold"

      - category: "Complexity Measurement Tools"
        adaptation_percentage: 5
        reason: "Each language has specific tooling"
        examples:
          python: "radon (cyclomatic complexity), pylint (code smells)"
          javascript: "eslint-complexity, jscpd (duplication)"
          java: "PMD (complexity, smells), JaCoCo (coverage)"
          rust: "cargo-geiger (complexity), cargo-tarpaulin (coverage)"
          go: "gocyclo, dupl, staticcheck, go test -cover (already used)"

      - category: "Code Smell Applicability"
        adaptation_percentage: 3
        reason: "Some smells are paradigm-specific"
        examples:
          oo_languages:
            applicable_smells: "All SQALE categories (Bloaters, OO Abusers, Change Preventers, Dispensables, Couplers)"
            note: "Java, Python (OO features), JavaScript (OO features)"
          functional_languages:
            applicable_smells: "Bloaters, Change Preventers, Dispensables, Couplers"
            not_applicable: "OO Abusers (no OO)"
            note: "Haskell, Elixir, some Rust patterns"
          procedural_languages:
            applicable_smells: "Bloaters, Change Preventers, Dispensables"
            not_applicable: "OO Abusers, Couplers (limited)"
            note: "C, some Go patterns"

      - category: "Static Analysis Issue Severity"
        adaptation_percentage: 2
        reason: "Language-specific linters have different severity models"
        examples:
          python_pylint: "Error (2h), Warning (0.5h), Convention (0.1h)"
          javascript_eslint: "Error (1h), Warning (0.3h), Info (0.05h)"
          java_pmd: "P1 (2h), P2 (1h), P3 (0.5h), P4 (0.1h)"
