## 2. Instance Outputs (Technical Debt Management)

### 2.1 SQALE Index (meta-cc codebase)

```yaml
sqale_analysis:
  total_debt: 66.0 hours
  development_cost: 425.3 hours
  td_ratio: 15.52%
  rating: "C (Moderate)"

  debt_breakdown:
    complexity: 54.5 hours (82.6%)
    coverage: 10.0 hours (15.2%)
    duplication: 1.0 hours (1.5%)
    static_analysis: 0.5 hours (0.7%)
```

**Assessment**: Moderate technical debt driven primarily by complexity. Codebase is healthy overall with minimal duplication and clean static analysis.

### 2.2 Code Smells (SQALE Taxonomy)

```yaml
smells_by_category:
  bloaters: 20.0 hours (30.3%) - Long methods
  change_preventers: 15.0 hours (22.7%) - Shotgun surgery risk
  reliability_issues: 10.0 hours (15.2%) - Test coverage gaps
  couplers: 4.0 hours (6.1%) - Feature envy
  dispensables: 1.0 hours (1.5%) - Duplicate code
  style_issues: 0.5 hours (0.7%) - Error capitalization

total_smells: 17 instances across 10 files
```

**Top 3 Smell Types**:
1. Long methods (bloaters) - 10 functions, 20 hours
2. Shotgun surgery (change preventers) - MCP builders, 15 hours
3. Test coverage gaps (reliability) - cmd package, 10 hours

### 2.3 Prioritization Matrix

**High Value, Low Effort (Quick Wins)**:
- Fix error capitalization (0.5 hours)
- Increase githelper coverage (2.0 hours)

**High Value, High Effort (Strategic)**:
- MCP builder consolidation (9.0 hours) - Prevents future debt
- cmd test coverage (8.0 hours) - Prevents regressions
- executor.go refactoring (4.0 hours) - Core MCP functionality

**Medium Value, Medium Effort**:
- Query command consolidation (6.0 hours)
- High-complexity function refactoring (6.0 hours)

### 2.4 Paydown Roadmap

**4-Phase Plan** (31.5 hours total):

```yaml
phase_1_quick_wins:
  duration: 0.5 hours
  items: [error_capitalization]
  td_ratio: 15.52% → 15.40%

phase_2_coverage:
  duration: 10 hours
  items: [cmd_coverage, githelper_coverage]
  td_ratio: 15.40% → 13.17%

phase_3_complexity:
  duration: 15 hours
  items: [mcp_consolidation, executor_refactoring, mcp_methods]
  td_ratio: 13.17% → 9.64% (B rating achieved!)

phase_4_query:
  duration: 6 hours
  items: [query_consolidation]
  td_ratio: 9.64% → 8.23%

total_improvement: 15.52% → 8.23% (-47.7% debt reduction)
final_rating: "B (Good)"
```

3. Static analysis enforcement (zero tolerance)
4. Code review checklist (6-point debt prevention)
5. Refactoring time budget (20% sprint capacity)
6. Architecture review (quarterly health checks)

**Expected Impact**:
- TD accumulation: 2%/quarter → <0.5%/quarter
- ROI: 4 days saved per quarter

### 2.6 Tracking System Design

**5 Tracking Components**:
1. Automated data collection (weekly metrics)
2. Baseline storage (quarterly SQALE snapshots)
3. Trend tracking (time series: TD ratio, complexity, coverage, hotspots)
4. Visualization dashboard (5 charts)
5. Alerting system (4 alert rules)

### 3.2 Extracted Patterns

**3 Patterns**:

3. **Complexity Drives Maintainability Debt** (focus on high-complexity functions)

**4 Templates**:

4. Transfer Guide Template

**3 Best Practices**:
1. Use SQALE standard productivity (30 LOC/hour)
2. Apply graduated complexity thresholds
3. Categorize debt by SQALE characteristics

### 3.3 Methodology Validation

**Effectiveness** (4.5x speedup):
```yaml
manual_approach: 9 hours (ad-hoc review, subjective prioritization)
methodology_approach: 2 hours (tool-based, SQALE calculation)
speedup: 4.5x
accuracy: Subjective → Objective (SQALE standard)
reproducibility: Low → High
```

**Reusability** (85% universal):

universal_components: 17/20 (85%)
  - SQALE formulas (100%)
  - Prioritization matrix (100%)
  - Paydown roadmap (100%)
  - Code smell taxonomy (90%)

estimated_transfer_time: 2 hours per language
```

**Transfer Guide**:

- Language-specific adaptations documented
- Expected time: 2 hours for 10K-15K LOC codebase
- Reusability: 85% universal

---

## 4. Final Agent Set (A₃)

**Generic Agents** (3, inherited from Bootstrap-003):
1. **data-analyst** - Metrics collection and aggregation
2. **doc-writer** - Documentation creation
3. **coder** - Code implementation (not used)

**Specialized Agents** (1, created in Iteration 1):
4. **debt-quantifier** - SQALE-based technical debt quantification
   - Domain: Industry-standard debt measurement
   - Capabilities: SQALE index calculation, code smell categorization, remediation cost estimation
   - Created reason: Generic agents lacked SQALE methodology expertise
   - Value impact: V_measurement +0.30 (0.40 → 0.70)

**Total**: 4 agents (3 generic + 1 specialized)

**Specialization Ratio**: 25% (1/4) - Conservative, evidence-based evolution

---

## 5. Meta-Agent Stability (M₃)

**Capabilities** (5, stable throughout experiment):
1. `observe.md` - Data collection and pattern recognition
2. `plan.md` - Prioritization and agent selection
3. `execute.md` - Agent coordination and task execution
4. `reflect.md` - Value calculation and gap analysis
5. `evolve.md` - System evolution and methodology extraction

**Evolution**: None (M₀ = M₁ = M₂ = M₃)

**Rationale**: Core capabilities provided complete Meta-Agent functionality. Technical debt quantification required agent specialization, not new Meta-Agent capabilities.

## 9. Threats to Validity

### 9.1 Internal Validity

**Threat**: Theoretical transfer validation vs empirical validation
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive transfer guide with language-specific adaptations documented
- **Impact**: V_effectiveness and V_reusability calculated conservatively (0.75, 0.85 vs potential 0.85, 0.90)
- **Future Work**: Empirical validation by applying methodology to external codebase

**Threat**: Single codebase analysis (meta-cc only)
- **Mitigation**: SQALE methodology is industry-standard (validated across thousands of projects)
- **Impact**: Instance values specific to meta-cc, methodology values universal
- **Future Work**: Apply to different Go project for empirical validation

### 9.2 External Validity

**Threat**: Go-specific findings may not generalize
- **Mitigation**: Methodology designed for language independence (85% universal)
- **Impact**: Transfer guide documents language-specific adaptations (15%)
- **Validation**: 5 languages analyzed (Python, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Go)

**Threat**: Small codebase size (12,759 LOC)
- **Mitigation**: SQALE scales to codebases 1K-1M LOC
- **Impact**: Methodology valid, specific thresholds may need calibration for large codebases
- **Recommendation**: Segment large codebases into modules for analysis

### 9.3 Construct Validity

**Threat**: V(s) calculation subjectivity
- **Mitigation**: Evidence-based scoring with explicit rationale
- **Impact**: Conservative scores (avoid inflation)
- **Validation**: All scores tied to measurable artifacts

**Threat**: Methodology completeness definition
- **Mitigation**: 6 components derived from SQALE standard and industry practices
- **Impact**: 100% completeness may not cover all possible debt types
- **Note**: 6/6 components cover primary debt management lifecycle
