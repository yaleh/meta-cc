# Principle: Platform-Context Prioritization

**Category**: Principle
**Domain**: dependency-management, risk-management
**Source**: Iteration 1
**Status**: Validated
**Tags**: [context, prioritization, deployment, platform-specific]

---

## Statement

**Prioritize dependency issues based on actual deployment context, not theoretical risk. Platform-specific vulnerabilities are lower priority if platform not used in production.**

---

## Rationale

Not all vulnerabilities affect all deployments:

- **Windows-specific vulnerability** irrelevant for Linux-only deployment
- **ppc64le architecture bug** irrelevant for x86_64 deployment
- **Feature-specific vulnerability** irrelevant if feature not used

**Risk = Likelihood × Impact**

If likelihood is zero (platform/feature not used), risk is zero regardless of severity.

**Platform-context prioritization**:
- Focus remediation on issues affecting actual deployment
- Deprioritize issues that cannot be exploited in production
- Still patch platform-specific issues (for completeness), but not urgently

**Avoid wasted effort**: Spending time on irrelevant issues delays fixing real risks.

## Evidence from Iterations

### Iteration 1: Platform-Specific Vulnerability Analysis

**Vulnerability**: GO-2025-3750 (Windows file creation race condition)

**Analysis**:
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Platform**: Windows-specific
- **Deployment**: Project runs on Linux (production servers)
- **Likelihood**: Zero (Windows code path never executed)
- **Impact**: Zero (cannot be exploited on Linux)

**Decision**:
- **Action**: Patched via Go upgrade (batched with other fixes)
- **Priority**: LOW (not urgent, fixed opportunistically)
- **Justification**: Zero production risk, but patch for completeness

**Alternative (no context)**:
- Treat as MEDIUM priority (based on severity alone)
- Waste time testing Windows-specific behavior
- Delay more critical work

### Iteration 1: Architecture-Specific Vulnerability Analysis

**Vulnerability**: GO-2025-3447 (P-256 timing sidechannel on ppc64le)

**Analysis**:
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Architecture**: ppc64le-specific
- **Deployment**: Project runs on x86_64 (Linux servers)
- **Likelihood**: Zero (ppc64le code path never executed)
- **Impact**: Zero (timing sidechannel not exploitable on x86_64)

**Decision**:
- **Action**: Patched via Go upgrade (batched with other fixes)
- **Priority**: LOW (not urgent, fixed opportunistically)
- **Justification**: Zero production risk, but patch for completeness

**Alternative (no context)**:
- Treat as MEDIUM priority (cryptographic vulnerability sounds serious)
- Waste time analyzing cryptographic implications
- Delay more critical work

### Iteration 1: Correct Prioritization Result

**HIGH priority** (urgent, affects production):
- GO-2025-3956: os/exec LookPath (Linux, x86_64, production code)
- GO-2025-3751: net/http header leak (Linux, x86_64, production code)

**LOW priority** (not urgent, platform-specific):
- GO-2025-3750: Windows file creation (Windows-only)
- GO-2025-3447: P-256 timing (ppc64le-only)

**Result**: Focused on HIGH priority (real production risk), batched LOW priority (opportunistic fix).

## Applications

### Application 1: Platform-Specific Risk Assessment

**Step 1: Identify deployment platforms**
- Operating systems: Linux, Windows, macOS
- Architectures: x86_64, arm64, ppc64le
- Environments: Cloud, on-premise, hybrid

**Step 2: Filter vulnerabilities by platform**
- List all vulnerabilities
- For each vulnerability, check platform applicability
- Deprioritize if platform not used

**Example**:
- Deployment: Linux x86_64 only
- Vulnerability: Windows-specific file handling bug
- **Decision**: Low priority (cannot be exploited)

### Application 2: Feature-Specific Risk Assessment

**Step 1: Identify used features**
- Which dependencies are actively used?
- Which APIs are called?
- Which configurations are enabled?

**Step 2: Filter vulnerabilities by feature**
- Vulnerability in unused API? Low priority
- Vulnerability in disabled feature? Low priority
- Vulnerability in critical code path? High priority

**Example**:
- Dependency: `http-server`
- Vulnerability: HTTP/2 parsing bug
- Project: Only uses HTTP/1.1
- **Decision**: Low priority (HTTP/2 not used)

### Application 3: Environment-Specific Risk Assessment

**Step 1: Identify deployment environment**
- Public-facing (internet-accessible)?
- Private network (VPN-only)?
- Airgapped (no network)?

**Step 2: Adjust priority based on exposure**
- Public-facing: All vulnerabilities HIGH priority
- Private network: Network vulnerabilities MEDIUM priority
- Airgapped: Network vulnerabilities LOW priority

**Example**:
- Vulnerability: Remote code execution (RCE)
- Deployment: Airgapped environment
- **Decision**: Still patch, but less urgent (no remote attackers)

## Prioritization Matrix

| Severity | Platform Match | Feature Used | Priority   |
|----------|----------------|--------------|------------|
| CRITICAL | Yes            | Yes          | CRITICAL   |
| CRITICAL | Yes            | No           | HIGH       |
| CRITICAL | No             | -            | MEDIUM     |
| HIGH     | Yes            | Yes          | HIGH       |
| HIGH     | Yes            | No           | MEDIUM     |
| HIGH     | No             | -            | LOW        |
| MEDIUM   | Yes            | Yes          | MEDIUM     |
| MEDIUM   | Yes            | No           | LOW        |
| MEDIUM   | No             | -            | VERY LOW   |

**Rule**: Actual risk = Severity × Platform Match × Feature Usage

**Example**: GO-2025-3750 (Windows), GO-2025-3447 (ppc64le)
**Application**: Deprioritize platform-specific issues for Linux deployment

**Transferability**: Concept applies to any ecosystem

### npm Ecosystem

**Platform Metadata**: npm audit includes platform info (node version, OS)
**Example**: Windows path traversal vulnerability
**Application**: Deprioritize for Linux-only Node.js deployment

**Transfer**: 100% applicable

### pip Ecosystem

**Platform Metadata**: pip-audit includes platform info (Python version, OS)
**Example**: Windows DLL loading vulnerability

## Trade-offs

### Benefits

- **Focused effort**: Work on real risks, not theoretical
- **Faster response**: Prioritize production-affecting issues
- **Resource efficiency**: Don't waste time on zero-risk issues

### Costs

- **Deployment knowledge required**: Need to know actual deployment platforms
- **Risk of assumption errors**: Misidentifying deployment platform
- **Completeness vs urgency**: Still need to patch eventually

### Mitigation

- **Document deployment platforms**: Maintain explicit list
- **Review quarterly**: Platform assumptions may change
- **Patch all eventually**: Low priority ≠ never patch

---

## When NOT to Deprioritize

**Don't deprioritize if**:
1. **Deployment context uncertain**: If unsure which platforms used, assume all
2. **Future deployment planned**: Planning to deploy on Windows? Don't deprioritize Windows issues
3. **Library distributed to users**: Users may deploy on any platform
4. **CRITICAL severity**: Even platform-specific CRITICAL issues need fast patching

**Conservative approach**: When in doubt, prioritize higher (false positive safer than false negative).

## Documentation Requirements

To apply platform-context prioritization, document:

1. **Deployment platforms**:
   - Operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS)
   - Architectures (x86_64, arm64)
   - Environments (cloud, on-premise)

2. **Used features**:
   - Which dependencies are imported?
   - Which APIs are called?
   - Which configurations are enabled?

3. **Network exposure**:
   - Public-facing vs private network
   - Authentication requirements
   - Firewall/WAF protection

**Location**: Create `DEPLOYMENT.md` in repository

- **Security-First**: Platform context modulates severity, doesn't eliminate it
- **Policy-Driven-Compliance**: Policy may define platform-specific rules
- **Test-Before-Update**: Test on actual deployment platforms

## Metrics

**Platform-Specific Metrics**:
- Total vulnerabilities: All vulnerabilities found
- Platform-matched: Vulnerabilities affecting deployment platforms
- Platform-mismatched: Vulnerabilities NOT affecting deployment
- Deprioritization rate: Platform-mismatched / Total

**Example from Iteration 1**:
- Total: 7 vulnerabilities
- Platform-matched: 5 (Linux x86_64)
- Platform-mismatched: 2 (Windows, ppc64le)
- Deprioritization rate: 2/7 = 28.6%
