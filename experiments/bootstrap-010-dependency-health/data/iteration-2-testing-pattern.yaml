# Pattern Description

description: |
  A systematic approach to testing and verifying dependency updates before
  applying them to production, ensuring updates don't break functionality,
  introduce regressions, or degrade performance.

  Dependency updates can introduce:
  - Breaking changes (API changes, behavior changes)
  - Performance regressions (slower code, more memory)
  - New bugs (upstream bugs in new version)
  - Incompatibilities (with other dependencies, with runtime)

  This pattern provides a comprehensive testing procedure to validate updates
  safely, with clear rollback criteria and automated validation.

# Problem Statement

problem:
  symptom: "Dependency updates applied without thorough testing, causing production issues"
  impact:
    - "Production outages (breaking changes not caught)"
    - "Performance degradation (regressions not measured)"
    - "Functional bugs (test coverage gaps missed new issues)"
    - "Compatibility issues (integration testing insufficient)"
    - "Difficult rollback (no clear criteria for when to revert)"

  indicators:
    - "Dependencies updated without running tests"
    - "Tests pass locally but fail in CI/production"
    - "Performance regressions discovered post-deployment"
    - "Incompatibilities discovered by users, not developers"
    - "Rollback decisions made reactively, not proactively"

  frequency: COMMON
  severity: HIGH (production stability risk)

# Context

context:
  when_to_apply:
    - "Before every dependency update (patch, minor, major)"
    - "As part of CI/CD pipeline (automated testing)"
    - "During manual dependency review (security updates)"
    - "Before release (comprehensive pre-release testing)"

  prerequisites:
    - "Comprehensive test suite exists (unit, integration, E2E)"
    - "Test suite has good coverage (≥80% code coverage)"
    - "Baseline metrics available (test pass rate, performance)"
    - "Version control available (for rollback)"

  ecosystem_applicability:
    go: HIGH (go test, go build, go vet)
    npm: HIGH (npm test, jest, mocha)
    pip: MEDIUM (pytest, unittest)
    cargo: HIGH (cargo test, cargo bench)
    maven: HIGH (mvn test, mvn verify)
    gradle: HIGH (gradle test, gradle integrationTest)

# Consequences

consequences:
  benefits:
    - "Catch breaking changes before production"
    - "Catch performance regressions before users notice"
    - "Provide objective rollback criteria (not subjective)"
    - "Build confidence in dependency updates"
    - "Reduce production incidents from bad updates"
    - "Provide audit trail (baseline vs after comparison)"

  drawbacks:
    - "Time investment (comprehensive testing takes time)"
    - "Requires good test coverage (gaps = missed regressions)"
    - "Performance testing complex (need representative workloads)"
    - "May be overly conservative (minor regressions rejected)"

  trade_offs:
    - "Thoroughness vs speed (comprehensive testing vs fast updates)"
    - "Strict vs lenient (fail on any regression vs accept minor issues)"
    - "Automated vs manual (script-based vs human judgment)"

# Examples from Iteration 1

examples:
  example_1_successful_update:
    context: "Iteration 1: Updated 11 dependencies"
    procedure:
      - "Ran go test ./... before updates (14/15 passing)"
      - "Applied all 11 updates together (batch)"
      - "Ran go test ./... after updates (14/15 passing)"
      - "Compared: No regressions (same 1 test failing)"
    outcome: "✅ Updates safe, zero regressions"

  example_2_build_verification:
    context: "Iteration 1: Go 1.23.1 → 1.24.9 upgrade"
    procedure:
      - "Ran go build ./... before upgrade (SUCCESS)"
      - "Upgraded Go toolchain (automatic via go get)"
      - "Ran go build ./... after upgrade (SUCCESS)"
    outcome: "✅ Build still works, no compilation errors"

  example_3_regression_avoidance:
    context: "Iteration 1: Pre-existing test failure"
    observation: "internal/validation test failing before updates"
    decision: "Noted as pre-existing, not a regression from updates"
    outcome: "Correctly distinguished pre-existing vs new failures"

    statement: "Always compare post-update results to pre-update baseline"
    rationale: "Objective comparison detects regressions missed by gut feel"

# Recommendations

recommendations:
  test_coverage:
    - "Maintain ≥80% code coverage (higher = more regression detection)"
    - "Cover critical paths first (authentication, payment, data integrity)"
    - "Add tests for past bugs (prevent regressions of known issues)"

  performance_testing:
    - "Establish performance baselines (benchmark critical operations)"
    - "Define acceptable regression thresholds (e.g., ≤10% slower)"
    - "Run benchmarks on representative data (production-like workloads)"

  automation:
    - "Script testing procedure (scripts/test-dependency-update.sh)"
    - "Integrate into CI/CD (run on every dependency update PR)"
    - "Auto-comment PR with test results (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)"

  best_practices:
    - "Update dependencies one at a time (easier to isolate regressions)"
    - "Batch related updates (e.g., all golang.org/x/* together)"
    - "Test in staging before production (real-world validation)"
    - "Monitor production after deployment (catch issues missed in testing)"

# Metrics
