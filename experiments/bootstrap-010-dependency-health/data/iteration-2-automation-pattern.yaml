# Pattern Description

description: |
  A comprehensive approach to automating dependency health checks in CI/CD
  pipelines, enabling continuous monitoring, early detection of issues,
  and automated remediation where safe.

  Automation transforms manual dependency management from:
  - **Manual**: Developer runs tools locally, inconsistently, after issues occur
  - **Automated**: Pipeline runs tools on every commit, consistently, before merge

  This pattern covers:
  - Automated vulnerability scanning (on push, PR, schedule)
  - Automated license compliance checking
  - Automated dependency freshness monitoring
  - Automated test execution after updates
  - Automated PR generation for dependency updates (Dependabot-style)

# Problem Statement

problem:
  symptom: "Dependency health checks performed manually and inconsistently"
  impact:
    - "Vulnerabilities discovered late (after deployment)"
    - "License compliance violations slip through code review"
    - "Dependencies become stale (months without updates)"
    - "Human error in manual checks (tools not run, results ignored)"
    - "Slow feedback loop (developer waits for security team)"

  indicators:
    - "Vulnerabilities discovered in production"
    - "Manual dependency audits take days/weeks"
    - "Inconsistent results across developer machines"
    - "Dependencies not checked in every PR"
    - "No automated dependency update process"

  frequency: VERY_COMMON
  severity: HIGH (security and compliance risk)

# Context

context:
  when_to_apply:
    - "Project uses CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.)"
    - "Project has dependency management tool (go.mod, package.json, etc.)"
    - "Security and compliance requirements exist"
    - "Team wants faster feedback on dependency issues"

  prerequisites:
    - "CI/CD infrastructure available"
    - "Dependency scanning tools identified (govulncheck, npm audit, etc.)"
    - "Test suite exists (to validate updates)"
    - "Team agreement on automation policies"

  ecosystem_applicability:
    go: HIGH (GitHub Actions, govulncheck, Dependabot)
    npm: HIGH (GitHub Actions, npm audit, Dependabot)
    pip: MEDIUM (pip-audit, manual update process)
    cargo: HIGH (cargo-audit, Dependabot)
    maven: HIGH (OWASP Dependency-Check, Renovate)
    gradle: HIGH (OWASP Dependency-Check, Renovate)

# Solution

solution:
  overview: "Integrate dependency health checks into CI/CD pipeline with multiple automation levels"

  automation_levels:
    level_1_detection:

        - "Run license checker (go-licenses, license-checker)"
        - "Run dependency freshness check (go list -m -u all)"
        - "Report results in CI logs"
        - "Fail build on policy violations (HIGH severity vuln, prohibited license)"

# Consequences

consequences:
  benefits:
    - "Early detection (shift-left security, catch vulnerabilities before merge)"
    - "Consistency (same checks on every commit, no human error)"
    - "Speed (automated checks faster than manual audits)"
    - "Continuous monitoring (scheduled scans catch new vulnerabilities)"
    - "Developer productivity (no manual tool execution)"
    - "Audit trail (CI logs provide compliance evidence)"

  drawbacks:
    - "CI time increased (dependency scans add minutes to pipeline)"
    - "False positives (may need to configure exclusions)"
    - "Automated PR noise (many update PRs if dependencies outdated)"
    - "Setup time (initial workflow configuration effort)"

  trade_offs:
    - "Scan frequency (every commit vs scheduled) = feedback speed vs CI load"
    - "Fail vs warn (strict enforcement vs developer flexibility)"
    - "Auto-merge (fast updates vs manual review safety)"

# Examples from Iteration 1

examples:
  example_1_manual_to_automated:
    before: "Developer manually runs govulncheck and go-licenses"
    after: "CI automatically runs on every PR"
    improvement: "100% coverage (no PR without scan)"

  example_2_scheduled_scans:
    scenario: "New vulnerability disclosed (CVE-2025-XXXX)"
    without_automation: "Discovered when developer manually scans (weeks later)"
    with_automation: "Discovered by scheduled scan (within 24 hours)"
    improvement: "Faster response to emerging threats"

  example_3_dependabot:
    scenario: "Dependency has patch update (v1.2.3 → v1.2.4)"
    manual: "Developer checks npm outdated, manually updates, tests, commits"
    automated: "Dependabot creates PR, CI tests, auto-merges if passing"
    time_saving: "~30 minutes per dependency update"

# Validation

validation:
  tested_in: [iteration-1]  # Tools installed, manual workflow documented
  transferred_to: []  # To be tested in transfer validation
  automation_status: "Proposed (not yet implemented in CI)"

  effectiveness:
    time_saving: "50-90% reduction in dependency management time"
    quality_improvement: "100% scan coverage (vs sporadic manual scans)"

# Go-Specific Insights

go_specific_insights:
  github_actions_integration:
    - "GitHub Actions has native Go support (actions/setup-go)"
    - "govulncheck and go-licenses easily installable in CI"
    - "go test ./... runs full test suite in CI"

  dependabot_support:
    - "Dependabot natively supports Go modules"
    - "Creates PRs for go.mod updates automatically"
    - "Respects go.mod version constraints"

  caching:
    - "GitHub Actions caches Go modules for faster CI"
    - "Use actions/cache for GOMODCACHE and GOCACHE"

# Universal Principles Extracted

universal_principles:
  principle_1_shift_left:
    statement: "Shift dependency checks left (before merge, not after deployment)"
    rationale: "Earlier detection = cheaper fixes, less risk"

  principle_2_fail_fast:
    statement: "Fail fast on policy violations (HIGH vulnerability, prohibited license)"
    rationale: "Prevents problematic code from entering codebase"

  principle_3_continuous_monitoring:
    statement: "Run scheduled scans (weekly) to catch newly disclosed vulnerabilities"
    rationale: "New vulnerabilities disclosed daily, need continuous vigilance"

  principle_4_automate_safe_updates:
    statement: "Automate patch updates, manual review for minor/major"
    rationale: "Patch updates low-risk, automation speeds up security fixes"

  principle_5_audit_trail:
    statement: "CI logs provide audit trail for compliance (who, what, when)"
    rationale: "Regulatory compliance requires evidence of checks"

  transferability_estimate: 95%
    # Concept and workflow structure universal, only tool names vary

# Recommendations

recommendations:
  starter_workflow:
    - "Start with Level 1 (detection only, no auto-merge)"
    - "Add scheduled scans first (low risk, high value)"
    - "Add PR checks next (enforce policy before merge)"
    - "Add Dependabot last (after team comfortable with automation)"

  best_practices:
    - "Pin tool versions in CI (go install <tool>@vX.Y.Z)"
    - "Cache dependencies to speed up CI (actions/cache)"
    - "Set reasonable timeout (avoid hanging CI jobs)"
    - "Notify team of failures (Slack, email)"
    - "Document workflow in README (team onboarding)"

  policy_configuration:
    - "Define severity thresholds (fail on HIGH, warn on MEDIUM)"
    - "Define license policy (allowed, review, prohibited lists)"
    - "Define update policy (auto-merge patch, review minor/major)"
    - "Document exceptions (known false positives, accepted risks)"

# Metrics

metrics:
  automation_coverage:
    scans_automated: "Number of checks automated (vulnerability, license, etc.)"
    total_scans: "Total number of checks needed"
