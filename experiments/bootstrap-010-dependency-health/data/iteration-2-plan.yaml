  gap_to_target:
    instance: -0.12 (EXCEEDED target)
    meta: +0.27 (NEED improvement)

  critical_issues:
    - "Pattern documentation incomplete (3/6 = 50%)"
    - "Transfer test not conducted (reusability claim untested)"
    - "Universal principles not extracted"

# Goal Definition

iteration_goal:
  primary_objective: "Complete methodology documentation and validate transferability"

  specific_goals:
    1: "Document remaining 3 patterns (bloat, automation, testing)"
    2: "Conduct transfer test on 3 ecosystems (npm, pip, cargo)"
    3: "Extract 5 universal principles to knowledge base"

  success_criteria:
    measurable:
      - "V_completeness ≥ 0.95 (5.5 of 6 patterns documented)"
      - "V_reusability ≥ 0.80 (transfer test validates ≥80%)"
      - "V_meta(s₂) ≥ 0.75 (approach convergence threshold)"

    specific:
      - "3 pattern YAML files created (bloat, automation, testing)"
      - "Transfer test report created (npm, pip, cargo results)"
      - "5 principle markdown files created in knowledge/principles/"

    achievable:
      - "Patterns based on Iteration 1 observations (extract, don't invent)"
      - "Transfer test uses existing methodology (apply, don't create)"
      - "Principles already observed (document, don't discover)"

  expected_ΔV:
    V_completeness: +0.45 (0.50 → 0.95)  # 5.5/6 patterns
    V_effectiveness: +0.05 (0.60 → 0.65)  # Better docs, no automation yet
    V_reusability: +0.30 (0.50 → 0.80)  # Transfer test validates

    V_meta_composite: +0.22 (0.53 → 0.75)
    V_instance: 0.00 (maintain at 0.92)

  constraints:
    focused: "Single primary: Complete methodology"
    achievable: "6-8 hours of documentation work"
    measurable: "Count patterns, measure transfer success, count principles"

# Risk Analysis

risks:
  risk_1_ecosystem_tool_limitations:
    risk: "npm/pip/cargo tools may not match Go tool capabilities"
    impact: MEDIUM
    probability: MEDIUM
    mitigation:
      - "Accept ecosystem differences, document adaptations"
      - "Focus on pattern transferability, not tool equivalence"
      - "Measure success as % pattern applicability, not 100% replication"
    fallback: "Lower transferability percentage if tools differ significantly"

  risk_2_time_constraint:
    risk: "Transfer test may take longer than estimated"
    impact: LOW
    probability: LOW
    mitigation:
      - "Use minimal examples, not full projects"
      - "Focus on tool capability mapping, not full implementation"
      - "Document approach, not execute every step"
    fallback: "Complete pattern docs and principles, defer full transfer test to Iteration 3"

  risk_3_pattern_extraction_difficulty:
    risk: "Patterns may not be as clear as expected"
    impact: LOW
    probability: LOW
    mitigation:
      - "Patterns already observed in Iteration 1"
      - "Use consistent YAML structure from patterns 1-3"
      - "Focus on what was actually done, not idealized process"
    fallback: "Mark patterns as 'proposed' status, refine in Iteration 3"
