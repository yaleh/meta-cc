# Validation Methodology

validation_methodology:
  approach: "Research-based validation (tool documentation, ecosystem surveys)"

  validation_steps:
    1: "Research equivalent tools in each ecosystem"
    2: "Map Go patterns to ecosystem-specific implementations"
    3: "Verify tool capabilities (documentation, examples)"
    4: "Calculate transferability % (components that work / total components)"
    5: "Document adaptations needed"

  evidence_sources:
    - "npm documentation (https://docs.npmjs.com)"
    - "pip documentation (https://pip.pypa.io)"
    - "cargo documentation (https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo)"
    - "Tool-specific documentation (pip-audit, depcheck, cargo-audit, etc.)"
    - "GitHub Dependabot documentation"

  limitations:
    - "No hands-on implementation (research-based only)"
    - "No performance measurement (speed comparison)"
    - "No full project testing (concept validation only)"
