# Pattern Description

description: |
  A systematic approach to identifying and removing unnecessary dependencies
  from a project, reducing bundle size, complexity, and attack surface.

  Dependency bloat occurs when:
  - Dependencies are added but never used (imported but not called)
  - Dependencies are no longer needed (refactoring removed usage)
  - Multiple versions of the same dependency exist (version conflicts)
  - Transitive dependencies bring unnecessary code (deep dependency trees)

  This pattern provides techniques to detect bloat, prioritize cleanup,
  and maintain a lean dependency set over time.

# Problem Statement

problem:
  symptom: "Project has dependencies that are not actively used"
  impact:
    - "Increased bundle size (longer downloads, more storage)"
    - "Increased attack surface (more code = more vulnerabilities)"
    - "Version conflicts (multiple versions of same package)"
    - "Slower builds and tests (more code to compile/process)"
    - "Dependency tree complexity (harder to understand and update)"

  indicators:
    - "go.mod shows many dependencies, but code uses few"
    - "go list -m all shows deep transitive trees"
    - "Multiple versions of same package in dependency graph"
    - "Build/bundle size larger than expected"
    - "Slow dependency resolution or installation"

  frequency: COMMON
  severity: MEDIUM (quality degradation, not functionality breaking)

# Context

context:
  when_to_apply:
    - "After major refactoring (removed features may orphan dependencies)"
    - "Before release (minimize bundle size for distribution)"
    - "During dependency updates (check if old deps still needed)"
    - "Regular maintenance (quarterly or bi-annually)"

  prerequisites:
    - "Project uses dependency management tool (go.mod, package.json, etc.)"
    - "Comprehensive test suite exists (to catch broken removals)"
    - "Version control available (to revert bad removals)"

  ecosystem_applicability:
    go: HIGH (go mod tidy, go list)
    npm: HIGH (npm prune, depcheck)
    pip: MEDIUM (pipdeptree, manual review)
    cargo: HIGH (cargo tree, cargo-machete)
    maven: MEDIUM (dependency:analyze)
    gradle: MEDIUM (dependencies task)

        6: "If tests pass, commit; if fail, revert and investigate"
        7: "Repeat for next dependency"

      go_specific:
        procedure:
          - "git checkout -b cleanup/dependency-bloat"
          - "go test ./...  # Baseline"
          - "go mod tidy    # Remove unused"
          - "go test ./...  # Verify"
          - "go build ./... # Check compilation"
          - "git commit -m 'chore: remove unused dependencies'"

      rollback:
        - "git revert <commit> (if removal breaks something later)"
        - "go mod tidy (restore from go.mod.backup if needed)"

# Consequences

consequences:
  benefits:
    - "Smaller bundle/binary size (faster downloads, less storage)"
    - "Reduced attack surface (fewer dependencies = fewer vulnerabilities)"
    - "Simpler dependency tree (easier to understand and maintain)"
    - "Faster builds (less code to compile/bundle)"
    - "Easier updates (fewer dependencies to update)"
    - "Lower maintenance burden (fewer licenses to track)"

  drawbacks:
    - "Risk of removing needed dependencies (if tests incomplete)"
    - "Time investment in analysis and testing"
    - "May need to re-add dependency later (if use case changes)"

  trade_offs:
    - "Conservative removal (keep questionable deps) vs aggressive cleanup (remove liberally, rely on tests)"
    - "Manual analysis (time-consuming, accurate) vs automated tools (fast, may miss context)"
    - "Continuous cleanup (small batches) vs periodic cleanup (large batches)"
