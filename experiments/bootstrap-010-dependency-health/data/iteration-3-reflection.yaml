  - All instance objectives completed
  - Maintained from Iteration 1, automation implemented in Iteration 3

  **Meta Layer**: ✅ CONVERGED
  - V_meta(s₃) = 0.85 EXCEEDS threshold (0.80) by 6%
  - All meta objectives completed
  - Automation implementation resolved V_effectiveness bottleneck

  **System Stability**: ✅ CONVERGED
  - M₃ = M₂ = M₁ = M₀ (meta-agent stable for 3 iterations)

  - Diminishing returns observed (ΔV declining)

  **Overall**: ✅ FULL CONVERGENCE ACHIEVED

  All 8 convergence criteria met or exceeded.
  Both instance and meta layers exceed thresholds.
  System stable (no evolution needed).
