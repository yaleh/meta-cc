  naming_style:
    snake_case: 100%
    consistency: Perfect

  parameter_design_score: 0.75
```

### Response Format Patterns

```yaml
response_patterns:
  hybrid_output_mode:
    description: Automatic switch between inline and file_ref modes
    threshold: 8192 bytes (8KB)
    inline_mode: "Results < 8KB returned directly"

    advanced_filtering: Good (SQL-like where clauses, jq filters)

  missing_features_identified:
    - Real-time monitoring/streaming queries
    - Aggregation across multiple sessions (cross-project)
    - Export to external formats (CSV, Excel, databases)
    - Visualization generation (charts, graphs)
    - Query result caching
    - Batch query operations

  edge_case_handling:
    large_results: Excellent (hybrid mode)
    empty_results: Unknown (need to verify)

  completeness_score: 0.65
```

### Evolvability Assessment

```yaml
evolvability_analysis:
  versioning:
    strategy: None observed in current API
    concern: No version numbers in tool names or parameters
    risk: Breaking changes would affect all users immediately

  deprecation_policy:
    documented: No
    concern: No clear path for phasing out old features

  backward_compatibility:
    concerns:
      - Adding required parameters would break existing calls
      - Changing default values could alter behavior
      - Response format changes could break parsers
    safeguards: Hybrid mode helps with output size changes

  migration_support:
    documentation: None observed
    tools: None observed

  evolvability_score: 0.30
```

## Value Function Calculation: V(s₀)

### Component Calculations

```yaml
V_usability:
  assessment:
    parameter_clarity: 0.75 (mostly clear, some ambiguity in advanced features)
    default_values: 0.85 (good defaults for most parameters)
    error_messages: 0.60 (technical, could be more user-friendly)
    documentation_quality: 0.80 (comprehensive MCP guide exists)
    ease_of_use: 0.70 (requires understanding of jq, regex patterns)

  calculation: |
    V_usability = (0.75 + 0.85 + 0.60 + 0.80 + 0.70) / 5
                = 3.70 / 5
                = 0.74

  honest_assessment: |
    Users can successfully use the API with documentation, but there's friction:
    - jq filter errors require debugging knowledge
    - Pattern syntax (regex) requires expertise
    - Hybrid mode file references require manual file reading
    - Some parameter interactions unclear (e.g., stats_only + jq_filter)

V_consistency:
  assessment:
    naming_conventions: 0.69 (mostly query_*, but some get_/list_/action variations)
    parameter_patterns: 0.75 (scope, jq_filter, stats_only mostly consistent)
    response_formats: 0.80 (hybrid mode applied uniformly)
    error_handling: 0.65 (standard MCP errors, but inconsistent error detail)

  calculation: |
    V_consistency = (0.69 + 0.75 + 0.80 + 0.65) / 4
                  = 2.89 / 4
                  = 0.72

  honest_assessment: |
    Strong consistency in core patterns (query_*, common parameters, hybrid mode)
    but notable exceptions create inconsistency:
    - get_session_stats vs query_project_state naming
    - cleanup_temp_files doesn't follow query pattern
    - list_capabilities vs get_capability (list vs get)

V_completeness:
  assessment:
    feature_coverage: 0.70 (covers major query needs, missing some advanced features)
    parameter_options: 0.75 (good parameter coverage, some gaps in filtering)
    edge_case_handling: 0.55 (hybrid mode excellent, other edge cases unknown)
    missing_functionality: 0.60 (no streaming, limited cross-session, no export)

  calculation: |
    V_completeness = (0.70 + 0.75 + 0.55 + 0.60) / 4
                   = 2.60 / 4
                   = 0.65

  honest_assessment: |
    Core functionality is solid, but gaps exist:
    - 3 tools rarely/never used (cleanup_temp_files, query_context, query_tools_advanced)
    - No real-time monitoring capabilities
    - Limited batch operations
    - No built-in visualization support
    - Hybrid mode is innovative but creates file cleanup burden

V_evolvability:
  assessment:
    has_versioning: 0.00 (no version strategy visible)
    has_deprecation_policy: 0.00 (no policy documented)
    backward_compatible_design: 0.50 (some patterns allow extension, but risks exist)
    migration_support: 0.00 (no migration tools or guides)
    extensibility: 0.60 (can add new tools, but parameter changes risky)

  calculation: |
    V_evolvability = (0.00 + 0.00 + 0.50 + 0.00 + 0.60) / 5
                   = 1.10 / 5
                   = 0.22

  honest_assessment: |
    Major evolvability concerns:
    - No versioning means all changes are potentially breaking
    - No deprecation path for old features
    - Adding required parameters would break existing users
    - Changing defaults could alter behavior unexpectedly
    - No documented approach for API evolution
    This is the weakest dimension and highest risk area.
```

### V(s₀) Total Calculation

```yaml
value_function:
  formula: V(s₀) = 0.3·V_usability + 0.3·V_consistency + 0.2·V_completeness + 0.2·V_evolvability

  calculation: |
    V(s₀) = 0.3 × 0.74 + 0.3 × 0.72 + 0.2 × 0.65 + 0.2 × 0.22
          = 0.222 + 0.216 + 0.130 + 0.044
          = 0.612

  components:
    V_usability: 0.74 (contributes 0.222)
    V_consistency: 0.72 (contributes 0.216)
    V_completeness: 0.65 (contributes 0.130)
    V_evolvability: 0.22 (contributes 0.044)

  result: V(s₀) = 0.61

  interpretation: |
    The API is at 61% of target (0.80), indicating:
    - Strengths: Usability and consistency are reasonably strong
    - Weakness: Evolvability is critically low (0.22)
    - Gap to target: 0.19 (19 percentage points)
    - Priority: Evolvability must be addressed for long-term API health

  honest_statement: |
    This baseline reflects the actual current state, not aspirational goals.
    V(s₀) = 0.61 is a fair assessment:
    - The API works well for current users (usability 0.74)
    - Patterns are mostly consistent (consistency 0.72)
    - Core features are present (completeness 0.65)
    - But evolution would be risky (evolvability 0.22)
```

## API Problem Identification

### Critical Issues (Urgency: High, Impact: High)

1. **Evolvability Crisis**
   - Problem: No versioning strategy, no deprecation policy
   - Impact: Any API changes risk breaking all users
   - Usage: Affects all 16 tools
   - Risk: Blocks future improvements, creates technical debt
   - Priority: #1

2. **Naming Inconsistencies in Core Tools**
   - Problem: get_session_stats vs query_project_state, get_capability vs list_capabilities
   - Impact: User confusion about naming patterns
   - Usage: Affects frequently used tools
   - Risk: Inconsistency compounds as more tools added
   - Priority: #2

### High-Priority Issues (Urgency: Medium, Impact: High)

3. **Error Message Clarity**
   - Problem: Technical error messages (e.g., "jq filter error: expected an object but got: array")
   - Impact: Users struggle to debug issues
   - Usage: Affects all query tools with jq_filter parameter
   - Risk: Reduces API usability
   - Priority: #3

4. **Parameter Interaction Documentation**
   - Problem: Unclear how stats_only, jq_filter, output_format interact
   - Impact: Users make incorrect assumptions
   - Usage: Affects 13/16 tools
   - Risk: Increases support burden
   - Priority: #4

### Medium-Priority Issues

5. **Hybrid Mode File Cleanup**
   - Problem: /tmp/ files created but no automatic cleanup guidance
   - Impact: Disk space accumulation
   - Usage: Affects all large result sets
   - Note: cleanup_temp_files tool exists but rarely used
   - Priority: #5

6. **Rarely Used Tools**
   - Problem: 3 tools have low/no usage (query_context, query_tools_advanced, cleanup_temp_files)
   - Impact: May indicate usability issues or missing features
   - Investigation needed: Why are these underutilized?
   - Priority: #6

### Low-Priority Issues

7. **Missing Advanced Features**
   - Problem: No real-time streaming, limited cross-project queries
   - Impact: Some advanced use cases not supported
   - Workaround: Users can work around with existing tools
   - Priority: #7

## Reflection

### What Was Learned About API Baseline

1. **Strengths of Current API**:
   - Hybrid output mode is innovative and solves real problems
   - Core query patterns (query_*, scope, jq_filter) are well-established
   - Comprehensive tool coverage for session analytics
   - Good documentation in docs/guides/mcp.md

2. **Critical Gap Identified**:
   - Evolvability is the weakest dimension (0.22)
   - This is not a minor issue - it's a fundamental risk
   - Without versioning/deprecation strategy, API is fragile
   - Addressing this should be first priority

3. **Usage Patterns Reveal Preferences**:
   - Users heavily favor query_tools and query_user_messages
   - File and time-series queries used moderately
   - Advanced features (query_tools_advanced, query_context) underutilized
   - This suggests either usability issues or feature mismatch

4. **Consistency Mostly Good, But Exceptions Hurt**:
   - 11/16 tools follow query_* pattern (69%)
   - The 5 exceptions create confusion
   - Small inconsistencies compound over time

### Completeness of Baseline Establishment

**Data Collection**: ✓ Complete
- 16 MCP tools identified and analyzed
- 467 tool usage records examined
- Usage distribution calculated
- Naming and parameter patterns extracted

**Value Calculation**: ✓ Complete
- All 4 components assessed honestly
- V(s₀) = 0.61 calculated from actual observations
- Component contributions understood
- Gap to target (0.19) identified

**M₀ Capabilities**: ✓ Complete
- 5 capability files discovered and adapted
- All adapted for API design domain
- Source experiments documented

**A₀ Agent Set**: ✓ Complete
- 8 agents discovered from union search
- Reusability assessed for each agent
- Expected evolution path identified

### Focus for Iteration 1

**Recommended Primary Goal**: Address Evolvability Gap

Rationale:
- V_evolvability = 0.22 is critically low
- Contributes only 0.044 to V(s₀)
- If improved to 0.70, ΔV = +0.096 (would raise V(s) to 0.71)
- This is foundational work that enables future improvements
- Without versioning strategy, other improvements are risky

**Specific Objectives for Iteration 1**:
1. Design API versioning strategy
2. Define deprecation policy
3. Document backward compatibility guidelines
4. Create migration path patterns
5. Calculate updated V(s₁) to measure improvement

**Agent Requirements**:
- Current agents (data-analyst, doc-writer, coder) may be sufficient for documentation work
- May need api-evolution-planner specialist if version strategy design is complex
- Evolution decision to be made in Iteration 1 planning phase

**Alternative Focus**: Naming Consistency
- If evolvability is deferred, could address naming inconsistencies
- Would improve V_consistency from 0.72 → ~0.85
- ΔV ≈ +0.04 (smaller impact than evolvability)
- Less foundational, but lower risk

**Recommendation**: Prioritize evolvability (foundational) over naming (cosmetic)
