```yaml
status: SUBSTANTIALLY CONVERGED
V_s5: 0.85
threshold: 0.80
gap: -0.05 (exceeds threshold by 0.05)

convergence_criteria:
  meta_stable: YES (M₅ = M₄ = M₃ = M₂ = M₁ = M₀)
  agent_stable: YES (A₅ = A₄ = A₃ = A₂ = A₁, 4 consecutive iterations)
  value_threshold: YES (V(s₅) = 0.85 ≥ 0.80)
  objectives_complete: PARTIAL (Tasks 2-3 complete, Task 4 deferred)
  diminishing_returns: APPROACHING (ΔV = +0.02)

completed_work:
  - Task 2: Validation tool MVP (100% complete, operational)
  - Task 3: Pre-commit hook (100% complete, operational)
  - Pattern 4: Automated Consistency Validation (extracted)
  - Pattern 5: Automated Quality Gates (extracted)

deferred_work:
  - Task 4: Documentation enhancement (0% complete, 2-3 hours remaining)
  - Pattern 6: Example-driven documentation (not extracted, deferred)
```

### Remaining Work

**Task 4: Documentation Enhancement**

**Scope** (from task3-documentation-updates-spec.md):
1. Update `docs/guides/mcp.md`:
   - Add "Parameter Ordering Convention" section
   - Update 10-15 examples to use tier-based ordering
   - Add 3 practical examples for low-usage tools:
     - query_context (error context retrieval)
     - cleanup_temp_files (temp file cleanup)
     - query_tools_advanced (SQL-like filtering)

2. Update `docs/reference/cli.md`:
   - Add `meta-cc validate-api` command documentation
   - Complete command reference with examples
   - Integration guidance (CI, pre-commit, development)

3. Create `docs/guides/git-hooks.md` (NEW):
   - Installation guide (automatic + manual)
   - Hook behavior explanation
   - Troubleshooting section
   - Advanced configuration

**Expected Outcome**:
- Complete documentation coverage
- Practical examples demonstrating conventions
- Users understand tier-based parameter ordering
- validate-api tool usage documented

## Data Collection

### Current State Assessment

#### V(s₅) Component Breakdown

```yaml
V_usability: 0.81
  components:
    error_messages: 0.90 (operational - validation tool working)
    parameter_clarity: 0.85 (operational - tier comments added)
    documentation: 0.80 (design quality - examples not updated)

  weakness: documentation component (0.80)
  improvement_opportunity: +0.03 to +0.05 possible with Task 4

V_consistency: 0.97
  components:
    design_layer: 0.96 (design quality + automation patterns)
    implementation_layer: 1.00 (operational - parameter reordering complete)
    enforcement_layer: 0.95 (operational - validation tool + hook)

  status: EXCELLENT (target achieved)
  improvement_opportunity: minimal (+0.01 max)

V_completeness: 0.73
  components:
    feature_coverage: 0.68 (validation tool adds enforcement feature)
    documentation_completeness: 0.80 (methodology added, examples pending)
    parameter_coverage: 0.75 (all params categorized)

  weakness: feature_coverage (0.68), documentation_completeness (0.80)
  improvement_opportunity: +0.02 to +0.03 with Task 4

V_evolvability: 0.87
  components:
    has_versioning: 1.00
    has_deprecation_policy: 1.00
    backward_compatible_design: 0.85
    migration_support: 0.65
    extensibility: 0.90

  status: STRONG
  improvement_opportunity: +0.01 with better docs
```

#### Weakest Components

**Priority 1: V_usability.documentation (0.80)**
- Current: Specs created, examples not updated
- Gap: Practical examples missing
- Impact: Users confused by inconsistent examples
- Addressability: HIGH (Task 4 directly addresses)
- Expected ΔV_usability: +0.02 to +0.03

**Priority 2: V_completeness.documentation_completeness (0.80)**
- Current: Methodology complete, user-facing docs incomplete
- Gap: validate-api command undocumented, git hooks undocumented
- Impact: Users don't know about enforcement tools
- Addressability: HIGH (Task 4 directly addresses)
- Expected ΔV_completeness: +0.02 to +0.03

### Files Analysis

#### Files Needing Updates

**docs/guides/mcp.md** (Primary Update):
- Current size: ~5000 lines (large file)
- Parameter examples: ~50-80 instances
- Consistency: Mixed (some examples updated in Iteration 4, many not)
- Missing: Low-usage tool examples (query_context, cleanup_temp_files, query_tools_advanced)

**docs/reference/cli.md** (Secondary Update):
- Current size: ~500 lines
- Missing: validate-api command section
- Impact: Users unaware of validation tool

**docs/guides/git-hooks.md** (New File):
- Status: Does not exist
- Impact: Users don't know how to install/use pre-commit hook
- Importance: HIGH (automation adoption)

---

## Pattern Recognition

### Documentation Patterns (from Iteration 5 observations)

**Pattern 6 (Partial) - Example-Driven Documentation**:

From task3-documentation-updates-spec.md analysis:

```yaml
pattern_name: "Example-Driven Documentation"
context: "Need to teach API conventions through documentation"

characteristics_expected:
  - practical_examples: Real-world usage patterns
  - tier_consistency: All examples follow tier-based ordering
  - low_usage_focus: More examples for rarely-used tools
  - progressive_structure: Simple → complex
  - annotated_rationale: Explain why, not just what

implementation_strategy:
  1. Add convention explanation section (tier system)
  2. Update existing examples (consistency)
  3. Add new examples (coverage gaps)
  4. Document validation tool (enforcement)
  5. Document automation (git hooks)

expected_structure:
  problem: "Users confused by abstract guidelines"
  solution: "Provide practical examples following conventions"
  verification: "Examples cover common use cases + edge cases"
```

### Gaps Identified

```yaml
documentation_gaps:
  gap_1:
    name: "Inconsistent parameter examples"
    current: "Mixed tier ordering in mcp.md"
    target: "100% tier-based ordering"
    addressability: HIGH
    expected_ΔV: +0.02

  gap_2:
    name: "Low-usage tools lack examples"
    tools: [query_context, cleanup_temp_files, query_tools_advanced]
    current: "Minimal or no practical examples"
    target: "3+ practical examples"
    addressability: HIGH
    expected_ΔV: +0.01

  gap_3:
    name: "Validation tool undocumented"
    current: "validate-api command not in CLI reference"
    target: "Complete command documentation"
    addressability: HIGH
    expected_ΔV: +0.01

  gap_4:
    name: "Git hooks undocumented"
    current: "No installation or usage guide"
    target: "Complete git hooks guide"
    addressability: HIGH
    expected_ΔV: +0.01

total_expected_ΔV: +0.04 to +0.05
```

## Priorities

### Iteration 6 Objective

**Primary Goal**: Complete Task 4 (documentation enhancement)

**Success Criteria**:
1. All parameter examples use tier-based ordering (consistency)
2. 3+ practical examples for low-usage tools (coverage)
3. validate-api command fully documented (completeness)
4. Git hooks guide created (usability)

**Expected Outcomes**:
- V_usability: 0.81 → 0.83 (+0.02)
- V_completeness: 0.73 → 0.76 (+0.03)
- V_consistency: 0.97 → 0.97 (maintained)
- V_evolvability: 0.87 → 0.88 (+0.01)
- **V(s₆)**: 0.85 → 0.86-0.87 (+0.01 to +0.02)

### Methodology Extraction Opportunity

**Pattern 6: Example-Driven Documentation**

**Expected Extraction**:
- Observe doc-writer's approach to updating examples
- Identify decision criteria (which examples to add, how to structure)
- Document example selection patterns (frequency vs. clarity)
- Capture documentation conventions (tier annotations, rationale explanations)

**Extraction Method**:
- Analyze specification vs. implementation choices
- Observe example structure patterns
- Identify coverage heuristics (low-usage tools prioritized)
- Document progressive complexity approach
