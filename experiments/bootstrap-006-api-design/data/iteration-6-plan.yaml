## Agent Selection

decision_tree_evaluation:
  task: "Documentation enhancement"

  step_1_straightforward:
    question: "Is this straightforward work?"
    answer: YES
    rationale: "Clear specification (task3-documentation-updates-spec.md), find-and-replace + examples"

  step_2_generic_sufficient:
    question: "Can generic agents handle this?"
    answer: YES
    rationale: "doc-writer agent designed for documentation tasks"

  step_3_specialization_needed:
    question: "Does this require specialization?"
    answer: NO
    rationale:
      - complex_domain_knowledge: NO (documentation update, not analysis)
      - expected_ΔV: +0.02 (< 0.05 threshold)
      - reusable: YES (documentation skills general)
      - generic_agents_sufficient: YES (doc-writer effective)
      - implementation_vs_design: Implementation work (favors generic agents)

  decision: USE_EXISTING(doc-writer)

agents_selected:
  - agent: doc-writer
    tasks:
      - Update docs/guides/mcp.md (parameter ordering + examples)
      - Update docs/reference/cli.md (validate-api command)
      - Create docs/guides/git-hooks.md (installation + usage)
    inputs:
      - data/task3-documentation-updates-spec.md
      - docs/guides/mcp.md (current version)
      - docs/reference/cli.md (current version)
      - scripts/pre-commit.sample (reference)
      - scripts/install-consistency-hooks.sh (reference)
    outputs:
      - docs/guides/mcp.md (UPDATED)
      - docs/reference/cli.md (UPDATED)
      - docs/guides/git-hooks.md (NEW)
    rationale: "Generic doc-writer agent sufficient for documentation updates per specification"

agent_evolution:
  A_6: A_5 (no new agents)
  rationale: "Generic doc-writer effective for Task 4, ΔV < 0.05 threshold"
  justification: "Fifth consecutive iteration with agent stability (A₁ = A₂ = A₃ = A₄ = A₅ = A₆)"

meta_agent_evolution:
  M_6: M_5 (no new capabilities)
  rationale: "Existing capabilities (observe, plan, execute, reflect, evolve) sufficient"
  justification: "Sixth consecutive iteration with meta-agent stability (M₀ = M₁ = M₂ = M₃ = M₄ = M₅ = M₆)"

## Execution Strategy

execution_pattern: SEQUENTIAL

sequence:
  1:
    subtask: subtask_1
    rationale: "Primary impact, largest scope"

  2:
    subtask: subtask_2
    rationale: "Documents new feature (validate-api)"

  3:
    subtask: subtask_3
    rationale: "Documents automation (git hooks)"

  4:
    subtask: subtask_4
    rationale: "Quality assurance, depends on 1-3"

dependencies:
  subtask_4: [subtask_1, subtask_2, subtask_3]

parallelization_opportunity: NO
  rationale: "Single agent (doc-writer), sequential tasks"

---

## Risk Assessment

risks:
  risk_1:
    risk: "mcp.md file large (~5000 lines), updates error-prone"
    probability: MEDIUM
    impact: MEDIUM
    mitigation: "Use Read tool to verify current state, Edit tool for precise updates"

  risk_2:
    risk: "Specification incomplete, ambiguities arise"
    probability: LOW
    impact: LOW
    mitigation: "task3-documentation-updates-spec.md detailed, fallback to consistent patterns"

  risk_3:
    risk: "Token budget exceeded before completion"
    probability: LOW
    impact: MEDIUM
    mitigation: "Task 4 scoped to 2-3 hours, prioritize subtasks 1-3"

overall_risk: LOW

## Convergence Projection

scenario_all_complete:
  assumption: "All 4 subtasks completed successfully"

  V_usability:
    current: 0.81
    projected: 0.83
    delta: +0.02
    rationale: "Documentation examples clear and consistent"

  V_completeness:
    current: 0.73
    projected: 0.76
    delta: +0.03
    rationale: "validate-api + git hooks documented, coverage improved"

  V_consistency:
    current: 0.97
    projected: 0.97
    delta: 0.00
    rationale: "Already operational, documentation doesn't affect"

  V_evolvability:
    current: 0.87
    projected: 0.88
    delta: +0.01
    rationale: "Better docs enable easier evolution"

  V_s6:
    calculation: 0.3(0.83) + 0.3(0.97) + 0.2(0.76) + 0.2(0.88)
    value: 0.249 + 0.291 + 0.152 + 0.176 = 0.868
    rounded: 0.87

  gap_to_target: -0.07 (substantially exceeds threshold by 0.07)

  convergence_criteria:
    meta_stable: YES (M₆ = M₅)
    agent_stable: YES (A₆ = A₅, 5 consecutive iterations)
    value_threshold: YES (V(s₆) = 0.87 ≥ 0.80)
    objectives_complete: YES (all 4 tasks complete)
    diminishing_returns: YES (ΔV = +0.02, < 0.05)

  status: FINAL CONVERGENCE (5/5 criteria met)

scenario_partial_complete:
  assumption: "Subtasks 1-3 complete, subtask 4 skipped"

  V_s6: 0.86 - 0.87
  status: STILL CONVERGED (4/5 criteria met, diminishing returns acceptable)

## Methodology Extraction Plan

pattern_6_extraction:

  pattern_name: "Example-Driven Documentation"

  observables:
    - Example structure (problem → solution → code)
    - Selection criteria (which tools need examples)
    - Coverage heuristics (low-usage tools prioritized)
    - Progressive complexity approach (simple → complex)
    - Annotation strategy (explain why, not just what)

  extraction_method:
    1: "Read task3-documentation-updates-spec.md (identify planned approach)"
    2: "Observe doc-writer's implementation (actual choices made)"
    3: "Compare specification vs. implementation (decision criteria)"
    4: "Analyze example patterns (structure, coverage, clarity)"
    5: "Document methodology pattern (context, problem, solution, evidence)"

  integration_with_existing:
    - Pattern 1: Tier-based categorization guides example structure
    - Pattern 2: Safe refactoring examples show backward compatibility
    - Pattern 4: Validation tool examples demonstrate automation
    - Pattern 5: Git hooks examples show quality gates

  expected_outcome:
    - Pattern 6 fully extracted and codified
    - API-DESIGN-METHODOLOGY.md complete (all 6 patterns)
    - Universal applicability validated
