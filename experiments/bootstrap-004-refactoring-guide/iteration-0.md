# Iteration 0: Baseline Establishment

**Experiment**: bootstrap-004-refactoring-guide
**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Duration**: Initial setup
**Status**: ✅ BASELINE COMPLETE

---

## Metadata

```yaml
iteration: 0
type: baseline_establishment
framework: Bootstrapped Software Engineering + Value Space Optimization
layers:
  - meta: Methodology development (V_meta)
  - instance: Concrete refactoring (V_instance)
```

---

## Evolution: System State Transition

### Meta-Agent Evolution (M₋₁ → M₀)

**Before**: No meta-agent existed
**After**: M₀ created with 5 capabilities

```yaml
M₀:
  capabilities:
    - observe.md: Code metrics collection and pattern recognition
    - plan.md: Refactoring prioritization and agent selection
    - execute.md: Agent coordination and refactoring execution
    - reflect.md: Value calculation and convergence checking
    - evolve.md: Agent specialization decision framework
  version: "0.0"
  status: "Active"
  domain: "Code Refactoring"
```

**Rationale**: Adapted proven meta-agent architecture from bootstrap-006-api-design, specialized for refactoring domain with safety-critical constraints.

### Agent Set Evolution (A₋₁ → A₀)

**Before**: No agents existed
**After**: A₀ = ∅ (empty set - no specialized agents yet)

```yaml
A₀: []
rationale: "Iteration 0 is baseline only - agents will be created in Iteration 1+ as needs emerge"
```

---

## Work Executed

### Phase 1: Data Collection (OBSERVE)

**Code Quality Analysis:**

1. **Cyclomatic Complexity (gocyclo -over 15)**
   ```
   Result: No functions with complexity ≥15 detected
   Status: ✅ PASS
   Files analyzed: tools.go, capabilities.go, root.go
   ```

2. **Static Analysis (staticcheck)**
   ```
   Violations: 37 unused code warnings (U1000)
   Breakdown:
     - capabilities.go: 36 violations (vars: 2, funcs: 34)
     - tools.go: 1 violation (func: 1)
   Status: ⚠️ MODERATE CONCERN
   ```

3. **Compilation Check (go vet)**
   ```
   Errors: 2 undefined symbols in root.go
     - GlobalOptions (line 71, 86)
   Status: ⚠️ COMPILATION ISSUE
   ```

**Code Duplication Analysis:**

```
Tool: dupl -threshold 15
Clone groups: 9
Total duplicated lines: 200
Total target lines: 1523
Duplication ratio: 13.13%

Breakdown:
  - tools.go: 3 clone groups (162 lines duplicated)
  - capabilities.go: 5 clone groups (36 lines duplicated)
  - root.go: 1 clone group (2 lines duplicated)

Major duplication patterns:
  1. Validation logic in tools.go (3 clones, 23 lines each)
  2. Error handling in tools.go (2 clones, 37-40 lines each)
  3. Small utility patterns in capabilities.go (multiple 2-6 line clones)
```

**Test Coverage Analysis:**

```
Tool: make test-coverage
Overall project coverage: 57.9% (cmd package)
Status: ⚠️ BELOW TARGET (target: 80%)

Coverage by module:
  - cmd: 57.9%
  - internal/stats: 93.6%
  - internal/testutil: 81.8%
  - internal/validation: 8.0%
  - pkg/output: 82.7%
  - pkg/pipeline: 92.9%
```

**File Structure Analysis:**

```
Target files:
  - cmd/mcp-server/tools.go: 395 lines (115 accesses)
  - cmd/mcp-server/capabilities.go: 997 lines (102 accesses) ⚠️ VERY LARGE
  - cmd/root.go: 131 lines (99 accesses)
Total: 1523 lines

Concerns:
  - capabilities.go is 997 lines - far exceeds recommended 400-600 line threshold
  - Large file contains 36 unused functions - indicates incomplete refactoring
```

### Phase 2: Value Function Calculation

**V_instance(s₀) Calculation:**

```yaml
components:
  v_code_quality:
    cyclomatic_complexity: 1.00  # No violations
    unused_code: 0.60            # 37 violations moderate
    static_analysis: 0.65        # Primarily unused code
    aggregate: 0.75

  v_maintainability:
    duplication: 0.73            # 13.13% ratio is moderate
    file_complexity: 0.60        # One very large file
    organization: 0.65           # Organizational issues
    aggregate: 0.66

  v_safety:
    test_coverage: 0.72          # 57.9% vs 80% target
    compilation: 0.70            # 2 undefined symbols
    aggregate: 0.71

  v_effort:
    estimated_hours: 28          # Total refactoring effort
    complexity: moderate
    risk_level: moderate
    score: 0.65

calculation: |
  V_instance(s₀) = 0.30×0.75 + 0.30×0.66 + 0.20×0.71 + 0.20×0.65
                 = 0.225 + 0.198 + 0.142 + 0.130
                 = 0.695

interpretation: MODERATE - Significant room for improvement
gap_to_target: 0.105 (need +10.5 points to reach 0.80)
```

**V_meta(s₀) Calculation:**

```yaml
components:
  completeness: 0.00  # No methodology exists yet
  effectiveness: 0.00 # No methodology to measure
  reusability: 0.00   # No methodology to evaluate

calculation: |
  V_meta(s₀) = 0.4×0.00 + 0.3×0.00 + 0.3×0.00
             = 0.00

interpretation: NO METHODOLOGY - Baseline before development begins
```

### Phase 3: Meta-Agent Setup

**Created Files:**

1. `meta-agents/observe.md` - Data collection and pattern recognition
2. `meta-agents/plan.md` - Goal setting and agent selection
3. `meta-agents/execute.md` - Coordination and execution
4. `meta-agents/reflect.md` - Evaluation and convergence checking
5. `meta-agents/evolve.md` - Agent specialization framework

**Adaptations from bootstrap-006:**
- Changed domain from "API Design" to "Code Refactoring"
- Updated value functions to refactoring components
- Added safety-critical constraints (test preservation)
- Modified agent templates for refactoring specializations
- Added compilation safety checks to execution flow

## Reflection

### Value Assessment

**V_instance(s₀) = 0.695**

**Component Analysis:**
- **Strongest**: V_code_quality (0.75) - No high complexity functions
- **Weakest**: V_maintainability (0.66) - Large file and duplication issues
- **Gap to target**: 0.105 (10.5 points needed)

**Interpretation**: Code is in MODERATE health. No critical complexity issues, but significant technical debt exists in unused code and duplication. Maintainability is the primary concern.

**V_meta(s₀) = 0.00**

**Interpretation**: No refactoring methodology exists yet. This is the baseline before methodology development begins through agent work observation and pattern extraction.

### Quality Assessment

**Baseline Data Quality**: ✅ EXCELLENT
- All analysis tools executed successfully
- Metrics comprehensively documented
- Data preserved in data/ directory
- Calculations shown and verifiable

**Meta-Agent Quality**: ✅ HIGH
- All 5 capabilities created
- Domain-specific adaptations complete
- Safety constraints integrated
- Based on proven bootstrap-006 architecture

**Gaps Identified**: ✅ COMPREHENSIVE
- 37 unused code violations cataloged
- 9 clone groups detailed with line ranges
- Test coverage gaps quantified
- File organization issues documented

### Convergence Check

```yaml
criteria:
  meta_stable: ❌ false (M₋₁ → M₀, first creation)
  agent_stable: ❌ false (A₋₁ → A₀, first creation)
  value_met: ❌ false (V_instance = 0.695 < 0.80)
  objectives_complete: ❌ false (no refactoring work yet)
  diminishing: ❌ N/A (first iteration)

status: NOT CONVERGED
rationale: "Baseline iteration - convergence criteria not applicable"
```

### Insights

**Learned:**
1. **Unused code is significant**: 37 violations suggest incomplete previous refactoring or feature removal
2. **Large file antipattern**: capabilities.go at 997 lines violates single responsibility
3. **Duplication is moderate**: 13.13% is addressable but requires systematic extraction
4. **Test gap exists**: 22.1% gap to 80% target requires focused effort

**Challenges:**
1. **Compilation issues**: root.go has undefined GlobalOptions - needs investigation
2. **Large file splitting**: capabilities.go splitting requires careful architectural decisions
3. **Safety preservation**: Must maintain test coverage during refactoring

**Surprising:**
- No high complexity functions despite large file sizes
- Most violations are unused code (easily removable)
- Test coverage varies wildly (8% to 93.6% across modules)

**Implications:**
- Quick wins available through unused code removal
- File splitting is highest-effort but highest-impact work
- Safety-first approach is critical (test preservation)

## Next Focus: Iteration 1 Priorities

### Priority 1: CRITICAL (Quick Win, Low Risk)

**Task**: Remove unused code from capabilities.go and tools.go

**Rationale**:
- 37 violations identified
- Low risk (unused code by definition)
- Quick execution (4 hours estimated)
- Immediate improvement to V_code_quality

**Expected ΔV**: +0.10 (0.695 → ~0.795)

**Success Criteria**:
- All 37 U1000 violations resolved
- Tests still pass (100% pass rate)
- Coverage maintained or improved
- staticcheck produces clean output

### Priority 2: HIGH (Moderate Effort, High Impact)

**Task**: Extract duplicated validation logic in tools.go

**Rationale**:
- 3 clone groups in tools.go (23 lines each = 69 lines duplicated)
- Reduces duplication significantly
- Improves V_maintainability
- Moderate effort (4 hours estimated)

**Expected ΔV**: +0.05 (improvement to maintainability component)

**Success Criteria**:
- Clone groups 1, 5, 7 in tools.go eliminated
- Common validation function extracted
- Tests pass with coverage maintained
- dupl reports reduced duplication

### Priority 3: HIGH (Moderate Effort, High Impact)

**Task**: Extract duplicated error handling patterns across files

**Rationale**:
- 6 remaining clone groups (capabilities.go, root.go)
- Further reduces duplication ratio
- Demonstrates pattern extraction methodology
- Moderate effort (4 hours estimated)

**Expected ΔV**: +0.04 (additional maintainability improvement)

**Success Criteria**:
- Remaining clone groups addressed
- Duplication ratio reduced from 13.13% to ~8%
- Common error handling utilities extracted
- Tests pass, coverage maintained

### Deferred: Medium Priority

**Task**: Split capabilities.go into logical modules

**Rationale**:
- Highest effort (16 hours estimated)
- Highest impact on V_maintainability
- Requires architectural decisions
- Should be done after removing unused code (reduces file from 997 to ~700 lines)

**Suggested for**: Iteration 2 or 3
