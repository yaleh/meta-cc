# Experiment: Meta-Agent Bootstrapping for Refactoring Guide

**Experiment ID**: bootstrap-004-refactoring-guide
**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: ⏳ READY TO START
**Framework**: Bootstrapped Software Engineering + Value Space Optimization
**Priority**: MEDIUM (Code maintainability and quality improvement)

---

## Overview

This experiment demonstrates Meta-Agent/Agent bootstrapping for developing a systematic code refactoring identification and execution methodology. It focuses on improving code quality, reducing technical debt, and maintaining system health.

**Key Objective**: Develop comprehensive refactoring methodology that identifies code smells, plans safe refactoring steps, and improves maintainability.

---

## Task Definition

**Task T**: Develop systematic refactoring identification and execution methodology for meta-cc

**Value Function**:
```
V(s) = 0.3·V_code_quality(s) +    # Code quality metrics
       0.3·V_maintainability(s) + # Ease of maintenance
       0.2·V_safety(s) +          # Refactoring safety
       0.2·V_effort(s)            # Refactoring efficiency

Target: V(sₙ) ≥ 0.80
```

**Initial State Analysis**:
- High-edit files: tools.go (115 accesses), capabilities.go (102), plan.md (423 accesses, 183 edits)
- Edit operations: 2,476 total - indicates frequent code changes
- Some files may have accumulated technical debt

**Expected Agent Evolution**:
- **code-smell-detector**: Identify code quality issues
- **refactoring-planner**: Plan refactoring steps
- **safety-checker**: Verify refactoring safety
- **impact-analyzer**: Analyze change impact

---

## Success Criteria

- Code quality metrics improved by ≥30%
- Technical debt identified and prioritized
- Safe refactoring procedures defined
- V(sₙ) ≥ 0.80
- Refactoring tools implemented

---

## Data Sources

**High-Edit Files** (refactoring candidates):
- docs/plan.md (183 edits, 423 accesses)
- cmd/mcp-server/tools.go (115 accesses)
- cmd/mcp-server/capabilities.go (102 accesses)
- cmd/root.go (99 accesses)
- cmd/mcp.go (97 accesses)

**Code Metrics** (to collect):
```bash
# Cyclomatic complexity
gocyclo -over 15 .

# Code duplication
dupl -threshold 15 .

# Static analysis
staticcheck ./...
go vet ./...
```

## Files Structure

- `README.md` - This file
- `plan.md` - Complete experiment design  
- `ITERATION-PROMPTS.md` - Iteration execution guide
- `meta-agents/meta-agent-m0.md` - Initial Meta-Agent

## Getting Started

1. Read [plan.md](plan.md) for complete framework
2. Read [ITERATION-PROMPTS.md](ITERATION-PROMPTS.md) for execution guide
3. Create meta-agents/meta-agent-m0.md
4. Execute Iteration 0 for baseline
5. Iterate until convergence
