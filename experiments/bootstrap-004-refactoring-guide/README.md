# Experiment: Meta-Agent Bootstrapping for Refactoring Guide

**Experiment ID**: bootstrap-004-refactoring-guide
**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: ⏳ READY TO START
**Framework**: Bootstrapped Software Engineering + Value Space Optimization
**Priority**: MEDIUM (Code maintainability and quality improvement)

---

## Overview

This experiment demonstrates Meta-Agent/Agent bootstrapping for developing a systematic code refactoring identification and execution methodology. It focuses on improving code quality, reducing technical debt, and maintaining system health.

**Key Objective**: Develop comprehensive refactoring methodology that identifies code smells, plans safe refactoring steps, and improves maintainability.

---

## Experiment Objectives (Two-Layer Architecture)

### Meta-Objective (Meta-Agent Layer)

**Goal**: Develop refactoring methodology through iterative observation, codification, and automation of agent refactoring patterns.

**Deliverables**:
- Refactoring methodology extracted from observed patterns
- Code smell detection heuristics
- Safe refactoring procedures with safety checks
- Refactoring impact analysis techniques
- Reusable refactoring three-tuple (M, A, methodology artifacts)

**Success Criteria**:
- V_meta(s) ≥ 0.80 (methodology quality threshold)
- Methodology completeness ≥ 0.80
- Methodology effectiveness ≥ 0.60 (measured speedup/quality improvement)
- Methodology reusability ≥ 0.70 (transferable to other codebases)
- Meta-agent stable (M_n = M_{n-1})
- Agent set stable (A_n = A_{n-1})

**Meta Value Function**:
```
V_meta(s) = 0.4·V_methodology_completeness(s) +
            0.3·V_methodology_effectiveness(s) +
            0.3·V_methodology_reusability(s)

Target: V_meta(s_n) ≥ 0.80
```

**Rubrics**:
- **Completeness**: 0.0-0.3 (Basic notes), 0.3-0.6 (Structured procedures), 0.6-0.8 (Comprehensive), 0.8-1.0 (Fully codified with examples/edge cases)
- **Effectiveness**: 0.0-0.3 (Marginal <2x), 0.3-0.6 (Moderate 2-5x), 0.6-0.8 (Significant 5-10x), 0.8-1.0 (Transformative >10x)
- **Reusability**: 0.0-0.3 (Domain-specific), 0.3-0.6 (Partially portable), 0.6-0.8 (Largely portable), 0.8-1.0 (Highly portable)

### Instance Objective (Agent Layer)

**Goal**: Execute concrete code refactoring for meta-cc high-churn files.

**Concrete Scope**:
- **Target Files**:
  - cmd/mcp-server/tools.go (115 accesses)
  - cmd/mcp-server/capabilities.go (102 accesses)
  - cmd/root.go (99 accesses)
  - cmd/mcp.go (97 accesses)

- **Specific Tasks**:
  1. Reduce cyclomatic complexity ≥15 functions (gocyclo analysis)
  2. Extract duplicated code (dupl -threshold 15 results)
  3. Implement refactoring safety checker (pre-refactor validation)
  4. Create impact analyzer (dependency analysis)
  5. Document refactoring procedures

**Success Criteria**:
- Cyclomatic complexity reduced by ≥30% in target functions
- Code duplication reduced by ≥40%
- All refactorings pass safety checks (test coverage maintained/improved)
- V_instance(s) ≥ 0.80
- Refactoring impact documented for each change

**Expected Agent Work**:
Agents execute concrete refactorings (function extraction, complexity reduction, duplication removal). Meta-agent observes patterns and codifies them into refactoring methodology.

## Task Definition

**Task T**: Develop systematic refactoring identification and execution methodology for meta-cc

**Value Function**:
```
V(s) = 0.3·V_code_quality(s) +    # Code quality metrics
       0.3·V_maintainability(s) + # Ease of maintenance
       0.2·V_safety(s) +          # Refactoring safety
       0.2·V_effort(s)            # Refactoring efficiency

Target: V(sₙ) ≥ 0.80
```

**Initial State Analysis**:
- High-edit files: tools.go (115 accesses), capabilities.go (102), plan.md (423 accesses, 183 edits)
- Edit operations: 2,476 total - indicates frequent code changes
- Some files may have accumulated technical debt

**Expected Agent Evolution**:
- **code-smell-detector**: Identify code quality issues
- **refactoring-planner**: Plan refactoring steps
- **safety-checker**: Verify refactoring safety
- **impact-analyzer**: Analyze change impact

## Convergence Criteria

Experiment concludes when **ALL** criteria met:

### Meta-Layer Convergence:
1. **Meta-Agent Stable**: M_n = M_{n-1} (no new capabilities needed)
2. **Agent Set Stable**: A_n = A_{n-1} (no new specialized agents)
3. **Methodology Quality**: V_meta(s_n) ≥ 0.80
4. **Methodology Complete**: All refactoring patterns extracted and codified

- Code quality metrics improved by ≥30%
- Code duplication reduced by ≥40%
- Technical debt reduced and prioritized
- Safe refactoring procedures validated (100% test pass rate)
- Refactoring methodology transferable to other projects

## Getting Started

### Pre-Experiment Setup

1. Read [plan.md](plan.md) for complete framework
2. Read [ITERATION-PROMPTS.md](ITERATION-PROMPTS.md) for execution guide
3. Understand two-layer architecture requirements

### Iteration 0: Baseline Establishment

**Objective**: Calculate V_instance(s₀) and V_meta(s₀) for both layers

**Tasks**:

**A. Instance-Layer Baseline (V_instance(s₀))**:
```bash
# 1. Code Quality (V_code_quality)
gocyclo -over 15 .
staticcheck ./...
go vet ./...
# Score: Count of violations → normalize to [0,1]

# 2. Maintainability (V_maintainability)
dupl -threshold 15 .
# Count lines of code in target files
# Score: Duplication ratio, file length, complexity

# 3. Safety (V_safety)
make test-coverage
# Score: Current test coverage percentage

# 4. Effort (V_effort)
# Estimate refactoring effort based on metrics
# Score: Complexity of required refactoring work

# Calculate: V_instance(s₀) = 0.3·V_code_quality + 0.3·V_maintainability + 0.2·V_safety + 0.2·V_effort
```

**B. Meta-Layer Baseline (V_meta(s₀))**:
```yaml
V_meta(s₀):
  completeness: 0.00  # No methodology exists yet
  effectiveness: 0.00 # No methodology to measure
  reusability: 0.00   # No methodology to evaluate
  V_meta(s₀): 0.00    # Baseline before methodology development
```

**C. Initial Setup**:
- Create `meta-agents/` directory with M₀ capabilities (observe, plan, execute, reflect, evolve)
- Create `agents/` directory for agent specifications
- Create `data/` directory for metrics tracking
- Document baseline metrics in `data/s0-baseline.yaml`

### Iteration 1+: Execute and Evolve

4. Agents execute concrete refactoring tasks (function extraction, complexity reduction, etc.)
5. Meta-agent observes agent work patterns
6. Meta-agent codifies patterns into methodology
7. Track V_instance(s) and V_meta(s) trajectories
8. Iterate until convergence (both layers meet criteria)
