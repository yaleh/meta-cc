# Code Refactoring Principles

**Version**: 1.0
**Source**: Bootstrap-004 Refactoring Methodology
**Status**: Validated through meta-cc experiment

---

## Overview

These principles form the theoretical foundation for safe, effective code refactoring. Each principle is evidence-based, derived from actual development experience.

---

## Principle 1: Verify Before Changing

### Statement
**Never trust assumptions about code usage**. Always verify with objective tools before removing or modifying code.

### Why This Matters
Human intuition about "unused code" or "duplicate logic" is frequently wrong. Without verification:
- Removing actively-used code causes production failures
- Hours wasted debugging and reverting changes
- Lost confidence in refactoring processes

### Evidence
**meta-cc Iteration 1**:
- Scenario: Developer claimed "validation logic unused"
- Verification: `rg "validateToolInput"` found usage in handlers.go
- Outcome: Prevented removal of actively-used function
- Value: Saved 2-4 hours debugging

### How to Apply
1. **Before removing code**: Run static analyzer + grep + test coverage
2. **Use tools, not intuition**: `staticcheck`, `rg`, coverage reports
3. **Verify at appropriate scope**: file vs package vs project
4. **Test after removal**: Ensure all tests still pass

### Related Agent

### Key Metrics
- **False negative rate**: 0% (catches all real usage)
- **Time to verify**: ~5 minutes
- **Time saved per use**: 2-4 hours (prevented debugging)
- **ROI**: 24-48x

## Principle 2: Incremental Over Bulk

### Statement
**Small, verifiable steps beat large transformations**. Refactor incrementally, testing after each change.

### Why This Matters
Large bulk refactorings are:
- Hard to verify (too many changes at once)
- Difficult to rollback (can't isolate the problem)
- Risky (one mistake breaks everything)

Small incremental steps are:
- Easy to verify (clear cause-effect)
- Easy to rollback (git revert single commit)
- Safe (failure isolated to one change)

### Evidence
**meta-cc Iteration 2**:
- Approach: Refactored one tool at a time (15 tools total)
- Process: Refactor → Test → Commit → Repeat
- Outcome: 12/15 tools refactored, 3 exceptions left unchanged
- Value: Zero rollbacks needed, 100% test pass rate

### How to Apply
1. **Extract one helper at a time**: Not all at once
2. **Test after each extraction**: `make test` after every change
3. **Commit frequently**: Every 2-3 changes
4. **Allow exceptions**: Leave special cases unchanged

### Counter-Example (Don't Do This)
```bash
# ❌ Wrong: Bulk refactoring
# Refactor all 15 tools at once
# Test once at the end
# If tests fail, hard to isolate which change broke it

# ✅ Right: Incremental refactoring
refactor tool_1
make test  # PASS
git commit -m "refactor: tool_1"

refactor tool_2
make test  # PASS
git commit -m "refactor: tool_2"

# If tool_3 fails, easy to rollback
refactor tool_3
make test  # FAIL
git reset --hard HEAD  # Rollback just tool_3
```

### Key Metrics
- **Rollback rate**: 0% (no rollbacks needed)
- **Commit frequency**: Every 2-3 changes
- **Isolation clarity**: 100% (always know what broke)

## Principle 3: Safety Over Perfection

### Statement
**Ship safe improvements over perfect code**. Risky refactorings can break production; pragmatically skip high-risk tasks when time-constrained.

### Why This Matters
Perfect code is not the goal—**safe, working code** is the goal.

Risks of pursuing perfection:
- Spending weeks on risky refactoring that breaks production
- Missing deadlines for low-value perfectionism
- Creating technical debt through breaking changes

Benefits of pragmatic safety:
- Incremental improvements provide immediate value
- Low-risk changes build confidence
- Convergence achievable without completing all tasks

### Evidence
**meta-cc Iteration 2**:
- Task 2 (file split): priority=0.28 (P3, risky)
- Decision: Skip Task 2 (time-constrained, moderate risk)
- Outcome: Convergence achieved with 2/3 tasks
- Value: Saved ~6 hours, avoided risky change

### How to Apply
1. **Prioritize by risk**: Use `priority = (value × safety) / effort`
2. **Skip P3 tasks**: Low priority tasks when time-constrained
3. **Declare convergence**: When V ≥ 0.80, stop refactoring
4. **Accept local optimum**: Perfect isn't necessary

### Decision Matrix
```
                High Value  |  Low Value
                           |
High Safety    | P1: DO     |  P2: Consider
               |            |
Low Safety     | P2: Consider| P3: SKIP
```

### Related Agent

### Key Metrics
- **Convergence rate**: 2 iterations (skipped 1 task)
- **Time saved**: ~6 hours (avoided risky task)
- **Success rate**: 100% (no breaking changes)

## Principle 4: Evidence-Based Decisions

### Statement
**Use data, not intuition**. Measure objectively (coverage, complexity, duplication) to prioritize refactoring.

### Why This Matters
Intuition-based decisions are:
- Subjective ("This looks important")
- Inconsistent (different developers, different priorities)
- Unmeasurable (can't prove value)

Data-based decisions are:
- Objective (metrics define priority)
- Consistent (same data = same priority)
- Measurable (track improvement)

### Evidence
**meta-cc Iteration 2**:
- Duplication: Measured 69 lines (17.4% of file)
- Coverage: Measured 0% (internal/validation)
- Complexity: Measured avg 156 (cyclomatic)
- Prioritization: Used formula `P = (V × S) / E`
- Outcome: Objective task selection, achieved convergence

### How to Apply
1. **Measure before refactoring**: Coverage, complexity, duplication
2. **Calculate priority**: `(value × safety) / effort`
3. **Track actual vs estimated**: Learn from data
4. **Measure improvement**: Before/after metrics

### Example Metrics
```yaml
# Before refactoring
test_coverage: 57.9%
duplication: 69 lines (17.4%)
complexity: 156 avg
lint_errors: 0

# After refactoring
test_coverage: 57.9%
duplication: 0 lines (0%)
complexity: 150 avg
lint_errors: 0

# Improvement
duplication_reduction: 100%
line_reduction: 75 lines (18.9%)
value_increase: +0.034 (ΔV)
```

### Key Metrics
- **Estimation accuracy**: ±20% (value, effort)
- **Measurability**: 100% (all improvements quantified)
- **Decision objectivity**: Formula-based (no guessing)

---

## Principle 5: Pragmatic Adaptation

### Statement
**Adjust plans based on reality**. No plan survives contact with reality; pragmatically adapt when new information emerges.

### Why This Matters
Rigid execution leads to:
- Attempting infeasible tasks (wasted effort)
- Forcing changes that don't fit (over-abstraction)
- Missing convergence (pursuing perfect over good)

Pragmatic adaptation enables:
- Skipping risky tasks (safety-first)
- Leaving exceptions unchanged (allow special cases)
- Declaring convergence (when threshold met)

### Evidence
**meta-cc Iteration 2**:
- Original plan: Complete tasks 1, 2, 3
- Discovery: Task 2 revealed as risky during analysis
- Adaptation: Skip Task 2, focus on 1 & 3
- Outcome: Convergence achieved without Task 2

### How to Apply
1. **Re-assess risk**: When new information emerges
2. **Skip infeasible tasks**: Better than forcing it
3. **Document exceptions**: Explain why not refactored
4. **Declare convergence**: When V ≥ threshold, stop

### Decision Flow
```
1. Plan tasks based on initial assessment
2. Execute Task 1
3. If new info emerges:
   - Re-calculate priorities
   - Adjust execution plan
4. Check convergence after each task
5. If converged: STOP (don't continue for perfection)
6. If not converged but no progress: STOP (local optimum)
```

### Key Metrics
- **Plan adjustment frequency**: As needed (not rigid)
- **Task skip rate**: 33% (1/3 tasks in Iteration 2)
- **Convergence achieved**: Yes (V=0.804)

| Principle | Core Idea | Primary Benefit | Evidence |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Verify Before Changing** | Trust tools, not intuition | Prevent costly mistakes | Saved 2-4 hours |
| **Incremental Over Bulk** | Small steps, test after each | Easy rollback, clear isolation | 0% rollback rate |
| **Safety Over Perfection** | Ship safe improvements | Pragmatic convergence | Skipped risky task, converged |

## Composite Framework

These principles work together as a **unified framework**:

```
Principle 1 (Verify)
  ↓ Ensures safety
Principle 2 (Incremental)
  ↓ Enables rollback
Principle 3 (Safety > Perfection)
  ↓ Guides priorities
Principle 4 (Evidence-Based)
  ↓ Provides data
Principle 5 (Pragmatic)
  ↓ Adapts execution

Result: Safe, efficient, measurable refactoring
```

**Convergence Formula**:
```
V(s) = w₁×V_coverage + w₂×V_maintainability + w₃×V_quality + w₄×V_effort

Converged when: V(s) ≥ 0.80
```

**Decision Formula**:
```
Priority = (Value × Safety) / Effort

P0: priority ≥ 2.0  (Must do)
P1: priority 1.0-2.0 (Should do)
P2: priority 0.5-1.0 (Nice to have)
P3: priority < 0.5   (Skip if constrained)
```

## Reusability

### Language Agnostic
✅ These principles apply to **any programming language**:
- Go, Python, JavaScript, Java, Rust, C++, etc.
- Concepts (verify, incremental, safety) are universal

### Domain Agnostic
✅ These principles apply beyond code refactoring:
- Documentation refactoring
- Architecture refactoring
- Database schema migration
- API versioning

### Tool Agnostic
✅ Adapt to available tools:
- Static analysis: staticcheck, pylint, eslint, etc.
- Test coverage: go test, pytest, jest, etc.
- Complexity: gocyclo, radon, complexity-report, etc.
