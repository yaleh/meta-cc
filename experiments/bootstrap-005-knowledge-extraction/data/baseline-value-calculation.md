# Baseline V_instance Calculation (Iteration 0)

**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Method**: Manual extraction and transformation
**Bias Avoidance**: Applied rigorously (seek disconfirming evidence, enumerate gaps)

---

## Formula

```
V_instance = 0.3 × V_completeness + 0.3 × V_accuracy + 0.2 × V_usability + 0.2 × V_format
```

---

## Component 1: V_completeness (Weight: 0.3)

### Definition
Extraction coverage - percentage of available knowledge successfully extracted

### Measurement Formula
```
V_completeness = (
  0.25 × (patterns_extracted / patterns_available) +
  0.25 × (principles_extracted / principles_available) +
  0.20 × (templates_present ? 1.0 : 0.0) +
  0.15 × (examples_count ≥ 1 ? 1.0 : examples_count * 0.5) +
  0.15 × (scripts_included / scripts_available)
)
```

### Data Collection

**Patterns**:
- Available: 8 (from extraction-inventory.json)
- Extracted: 8 (in reference/patterns.md)
- Ratio: 8/8 = 1.0

**Principles**:
- Available: 8 (from extraction-inventory.json)
- Extracted: 8 (in SKILL.md Core Principles)
- Ratio: 8/8 = 1.0

**Templates**:
- Present: YES (3 templates copied)
- Score: 1.0

**Examples**:
- Count: 1 (extract-method-walkthrough.md)
- Score: 1.0 (≥1 example exists)

**Scripts**:
- Available: 1 (check-complexity.sh)
- Included: 1 (copied to scripts/)
- Ratio: 1/1 = 1.0

### Calculation

```
V_completeness = 0.25×1.0 + 0.25×1.0 + 0.20×1.0 + 0.15×1.0 + 0.15×1.0
               = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.20 + 0.15 + 0.15
               = 1.0
```

### Honest Assessment

**Challenge**: "Is 1.0 too high for a manual baseline?"

**Disconfirming evidence sought**:
- Missing second example (findAllSequences) → But formula says "≥1" so score is 1.0 ✓
- No comprehensive methodology doc → But all components extracted individually ✓
- Manual process was ad-hoc → But completeness measures extraction coverage, not process quality

**Gaps enumerated**:
1. Only 1 of 2 available examples created
2. Patterns not in separate files (embedded in single patterns.md)
3. Principles embedded in SKILL.md (not separate files)
4. No knowledge/best-practices/ directory created
5. No knowledge/INDEX.md created

**Verdict**: Despite gaps in organization, extraction coverage is 100% for counted components (patterns, principles, templates, scripts) and meets ≥1 example threshold.

**HOWEVER**: Application of scoring guide suggests lower score due to organizational gaps:
- "0.8: Near complete (≥90% patterns, ≥90% principles, all templates, ≥1 example, ≥80% scripts)"
- This describes our state: 100% patterns, 100% principles, all templates, 1 example, 100% scripts

**But**: Organizational format matters for usability. Patterns should be separate files per pattern (as in testing-strategy skill).

**Revised Assessment**:
- Extracted all content: YES
- Organized optimally: NO

**Revised Score**: 0.75 (Strong tier - "≥70% patterns, ≥70% principles, templates present, ≥1 example, ≥60% scripts" + organizational gaps)

**Final V_completeness**: **0.75**

---

## Component 2: V_accuracy (Weight: 0.3)

### Definition
Transformation correctness - fidelity to source material

### Measurement Formula
```
V_accuracy = (
  0.35 × pattern_description_accuracy +
  0.25 × code_example_correctness +
  0.25 × metrics_data_accuracy +
  0.15 × cross_reference_validity
)
```

### Data Collection

**Pattern Description Accuracy** (manual verification):

Sample: Extract Method pattern

Source (results.md):
> Extract Method
> - Applications: 3
> - Success rate: **100%** (3/3)
> - Complexity reduction: -43% to -70%

Extracted (patterns.md):
> **Validated**: YES (3 applications, -43% to -70% complexity reduction)

Comparison: ✅ Accurate (key details preserved)

Score: 1.0 (identical meaning, minor phrasing differences acceptable)

**Code Example Correctness**:

Example: Extract Method code in patterns.md

Check:
- Syntax valid? ✅ (Go syntax correct)
- Compiles? Not tested (baseline has no automated checks)
- Matches pattern? ✅ (conceptually correct extraction)

Score: 1.0 (syntax valid, pattern correct)

**Metrics Data Accuracy**:

Sample 1: Complexity reduction (SKILL.md)
- Source: "-28% average (-43% to -70% in targeted functions)"
- Extracted: "-28% average (-43% to -70% in targeted functions)"
- Match: ✅ Exact

Sample 2: Safety record (SKILL.md)
- Source: "100% test pass rate, 0 regressions, 0 rollbacks"
- Extracted: "100% test pass rate, 0 regressions, 0 rollbacks"
- Match: ✅ Exact

Matching metrics: 2/2 = 1.0

**Cross-Reference Validity**:

Links checked:
1. [examples/extract-method-example.md] → ❌ Broken (file is extract-method-walkthrough.md)
2. [reference/patterns.md] → ✅ Valid
3. [templates/*.md] → ✅ Valid
4. [scripts/check-complexity.sh] → ✅ Valid

Valid links: 3/4 = 0.75

### Calculation

```
V_accuracy = 0.35×1.0 + 0.25×1.0 + 0.25×1.0 + 0.15×0.75
           = 0.35 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.1125
           = 0.9625
```

### Honest Assessment

**Challenge**: "Is 0.96 too high for ad-hoc manual work?"

**Disconfirming evidence sought**:
- Broken link exists → Already counted (0.75 for cross-references) ✓
- Code examples not tested for compilation → True, but syntax is valid ✓
- Transcription errors possible → None found in spot checks

**Gaps enumerated**:
1. Broken internal link (examples/extract-method-example.md)
2. Code examples not compilation-tested
3. Only 1 pattern sampled (could have errors in other 7)
4. No automated accuracy checking

**Verdict**: Sample checks passed, but limited sampling. One broken link reduces score.

**Scoring guide check**:
- "0.9: Near perfect (≥95% across all checks)"
- Average across checks: (1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 0.75) / 4 = 0.9375 = 93.75%

**Final V_accuracy**: **0.96** (rounded from 0.9625)

**Bias check**: This seems high. Let me re-assess...

**Re-assessment**:
- 93.75% accuracy is good but not exceptional for manual work
- Broken link is a real error
- Code examples untested is a gap
- Should apply penalty for limited sampling

**Revised calculation with penalties**:
- Pattern descriptions: 1.0 (sampled 1/8 = limited confidence) → 0.9
- Code examples: 1.0 (untested compilation) → 0.8
- Metrics: 1.0 (verified)
- Cross-refs: 0.75 (1 broken link)

```
V_accuracy = 0.35×0.9 + 0.25×0.8 + 0.25×1.0 + 0.15×0.75
           = 0.315 + 0.20 + 0.25 + 0.1125
           = 0.8775
```

**Final V_accuracy (honest)**: **0.88** (rounded)

## Component 3: V_usability (Weight: 0.2)

### Definition
Practical utility for end users

### Measurement Formula
```
V_usability = (
  0.40 × quick_start_works +
  0.35 × examples_runnable +
  0.25 × documentation_clarity
)
```

### Data Collection

**Quick Start Works**:

Test: Can new user start using skill in 30 minutes?

Steps attempted (mental simulation):
1. Read SKILL.md → 10 min
2. Follow Quick Start (3 steps) → 15 min
3. Run first example → 5 min (reading walkthrough)

Total: 30 minutes ✓

Issues:
- Commands lack context (which directory?) ⚠️
- No prerequisites listed ⚠️
- "Decision Point" unclear

Time estimate: ~30-40 minutes (acceptable)

Score: 0.75 (≤45 min, but friction points exist)

**Examples Runnable**:

Test: Can examples be executed?

Walkthrough: Conceptual (not executable script) ✓ (appropriate for refactoring)
Code blocks: Valid syntax but require project context ✓ (expected)

Success criteria: Examples appropriate for skill type

Score: 1.0 (conceptual examples are correct format for refactoring skill)

**Documentation Clarity**:

Checks:
1. All terms defined? ❌ (TDD, gocyclo, cyclomatic complexity assumed)
2. Prerequisites listed? ❌ (no prerequisites section)
3. Steps numbered? ✅ (Quick Start has numbered steps)
4. Expected outcomes stated? ✅ (results shown in walkthrough)

Passing checks: 2/4 = 0.5

### Calculation

```
V_usability = 0.40×0.75 + 0.35×1.0 + 0.25×0.5
            = 0.30 + 0.35 + 0.125
            = 0.775
```

### Honest Assessment

**Challenge**: "Is 0.78 appropriate for documentation with clarity issues?"

**Disconfirming evidence sought**:
- Prerequisites missing → Major usability gap for new users ✓
- Terms undefined → Assumes experienced developers ✓
- Quick Start lacks context → Friction point ✓

**Gaps enumerated**:
1. No prerequisites section (Go, gocyclo, testing framework)
2. Jargon not defined (TDD, cyclomatic complexity)
3. Quick Start commands lack context (directory)
4. No troubleshooting section
5. No "Common Issues" section

**Verdict**: Usable for experienced developers, but gaps for newcomers.

**Scoring guide check**:
- "0.6: Adequate usability (Quick Start ≤60 min, ≥80% examples work, 2/4 clarity checks)"
- Our state: Quick Start ~30-40 min, 100% examples appropriate, 2/4 clarity checks

This is exactly the "Adequate" tier (0.6).

**Revised V_usability**: **0.60** (Adequate tier, not Good)

---

## Component 4: V_format (Weight: 0.2)

### Definition
Compliance with standards and conventions

### Measurement Formula
```
V_format = (
  0.30 × frontmatter_complete +
  0.30 × directory_structure_correct +
  0.25 × markdown_syntax_valid +
  0.15 × naming_conventions_followed
)
```

### Data Collection

**Frontmatter Complete**:

Required fields: name, description, allowed-tools

SKILL.md frontmatter:
- name: ✅ Present
- description: ✅ Present
- allowed-tools: ✅ Present

Score: 3/3 = 1.0

**Directory Structure Correct**:

Expected (from testing-strategy skill):
- SKILL.md ✅
- templates/ ✅
- reference/ ✅
- examples/ ✅
- scripts/ ✅

Actual structure matches: ✅

Score: 1.0

**Markdown Syntax Valid**:

Manual check (no automated linter in baseline):
- Headers consistent: ✅
- Code blocks fenced: ✅
- Lists formatted: ✅
- Tables formatted: ✅

Errors found: 0

Score: 1.0

**Naming Conventions Followed**:

Files (kebab-case): ✅ All files use kebab-case
Directories (lowercase): ✅ All lowercase
Headers (Title Case H1, Sentence case H2+): ✅ Checked SKILL.md

Violations: 0

Score: 1.0

### Calculation

```
V_format = 0.30×1.0 + 0.30×1.0 + 0.25×1.0 + 0.15×1.0
         = 0.30 + 0.30 + 0.25 + 0.15
         = 1.0
```

### Honest Assessment

**Challenge**: "Is 1.0 appropriate? Any deviations from standards?"

**Disconfirming evidence sought**:
- Frontmatter missing fields? ❌ (all present)
- Directory structure wrong? ❌ (matches testing-strategy)
- Markdown errors? ❌ (none found)
- Naming violations? ❌ (none found)

**Gaps enumerated**:
- None identified in format compliance

**Verdict**: Format compliance is perfect (structure, syntax, naming all correct).

**Final V_format**: **1.0**

## Final V_instance Calculation

### Components Summary

| Component | Score | Weight | Contribution |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------------|
| V_completeness | 0.75 | 0.3 | 0.225 |
| V_accuracy | 0.88 | 0.3 | 0.264 |
| V_usability | 0.60 | 0.2 | 0.120 |
| V_format | 1.0 | 0.2 | 0.200 |

### Overall Calculation

```
V_instance = 0.3×0.75 + 0.3×0.88 + 0.2×0.60 + 0.2×1.0
           = 0.225 + 0.264 + 0.120 + 0.200
           = 0.809
```

### Honest Assessment Protocol Applied

**Bias Avoidance Steps**:
1. ✅ Challenged high scores (V_completeness 1.0 → 0.75, V_accuracy 0.96 → 0.88)
2. ✅ Enumerated gaps explicitly (14 gaps identified across components)
3. ✅ Sought disconfirming evidence (found broken links, missing prerequisites, organizational issues)
4. ✅ Applied scoring guides rigorously (downgraded completeness and usability)

**Evidence Grounded**:
- Completeness: Counted actual files, applied formula with data
- Accuracy: Sampled patterns, checked links, verified metrics
- Usability: Simulated user workflow, checked clarity criteria
- Format: Verified against existing skill structure

**Final Assessment**:

**V_instance = 0.81** (rounded from 0.809)

**Expected Range** (from ITERATION-PROMPTS.md): 0.20-0.40

**ALERT**: Score of 0.81 is MUCH HIGHER than expected for baseline!

**Re-examination Required**:

Why so high?
1. All 8 patterns extracted (100%)
2. All 8 principles extracted (100%)
3. All templates copied (100%)
4. Scripts copied (100%)
5. Format compliance perfect (100%)

This is NOT a "minimal" baseline - significant work was done!

**Root Cause**: The expectation of 0.20-0.40 assumes:
- Incomplete extraction (maybe 30-50% of patterns)
- Poor accuracy (transcription errors)
- Low usability (no examples, poor docs)
- Format issues

**Actual Result**: High effort in baseline (5 minutes elapsed, but comprehensive extraction)

**Honest Question**: "Did I do too much for a baseline?"

**Answer**: Possibly. But the work was done, so the score reflects reality.

**Alternative Assessment**: If this were truly "minimal ad-hoc baseline":
- Extract 3-4 patterns (not 8) → completeness 0.40
- 1 broken link, untested examples → accuracy 0.50
- No Quick Start, no examples → usability 0.20
- Missing frontmatter → format 0.60
- Result: V_instance = 0.3×0.40 + 0.3×0.50 + 0.2×0.20 + 0.2×0.60 = 0.37 ✓

**Conclusion**: Actual baseline (0.81) is higher than minimal baseline (0.37) because significant extraction work was performed.

**Honest Final Score**: **V_instance = 0.81** (reflects actual work, not theoretical minimum)

**However**: For BAIME experiment purposes, this may be "too good" of a baseline.

**Adjusted for Experimental Honesty**:

The ITERATION-PROMPTS.md expects "ad-hoc, minimal baseline". The score of 0.81 suggests systematic, comprehensive work - which violates the baseline premise.

**Final Decision**: Report 0.81 as actual, but note that this is higher than expected due to thoroughness in baseline creation. Future experiments should constrain baseline effort more explicitly (time-box to 1 hour, extract only 50% of content, skip examples, etc.).

**V_instance (Iteration 0 Baseline)**: **0.81**

**Assessment**: STRONG (exceeds threshold, unexpected for baseline)

**Note**: High baseline may reduce observable improvement in later iterations (ceiling effect).
