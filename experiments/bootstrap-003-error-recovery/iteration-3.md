# Iteration 3: Recovery Procedures Development

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Duration**: ~4-5 hours
**Status**: completed
**Focus**: recovery_procedures_and_automation_strategies

---

## Overview

Iteration 3 develops comprehensive recovery procedures and automation strategies for all error categories identified in diagnostic procedures (Iteration 2). This iteration transforms error diagnosis into systematic recovery by creating complete recovery strategies, automation classifications, validation frameworks, and recovery automation tool specifications.

---

## Meta-Agent Evolution

### M₂ → M₃

**Status**: M₃ = M₂ = M₁ = M₀ (No Meta-Agent evolution)

Meta-Agent remains unchanged with five core capabilities:

```yaml
M₃:
  version: 0.0
  capabilities: [observe, plan, execute, reflect, evolve]
  status: Sufficient for current coordination needs
```

**Rationale**: The five core capabilities continue to be sufficient for coordinating recovery procedure development. No new meta-level coordination patterns were needed. M.plan successfully selected appropriate agent specialization (recovery-advisor), M.execute coordinated work, M.reflect evaluated results.

## Agent Set Evolution

### A₂ → A₃

**Evolution**: A₃ = A₂ ∪ {recovery-advisor}

**New Agent Created**: `recovery-advisor` (Specialized)

```yaml
A₃:
  existing_agents:
    - name: data-analyst
      specialization: low (generic)
      status: active
      used_in_iteration_3: no

    - name: doc-writer
      specialization: low (generic)
      status: active
      used_in_iteration_3: yes

    - name: coder
      specialization: low (generic)
      status: active
      used_in_iteration_3: no

    - name: error-classifier
      specialization: high (specialized)
      status: active
      created: iteration 1
      used_in_iteration_3: no

    - name: root-cause-analyzer
      specialization: high (specialized)
      status: active
      created: iteration 2
      used_in_iteration_3: no (diagnostic procedures stable)

  new_agents:
    - name: recovery-advisor
      file: agents/recovery-advisor.md
      specialization: high (specialized)
      domain: error recovery strategy design and remediation procedures
      created: iteration 3
      status: active
      used_in_iteration_3: yes
```

### Specialization Rationale (recovery-advisor)

**Why specialized agent needed?**

Recovery strategy design is a distinct domain from error diagnosis:

| Aspect | Diagnosis (root-cause-analyzer) | Recovery (recovery-advisor) |
|--------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Focus** | Why did it happen? | How do we fix it? |
| **Output** | Root cause identification | Recovery procedure + automation |
| **Input** | Error + context | Root cause + diagnostic procedure |
| **Method** | Causal chain analysis | Solution design + validation |
| **Expertise** | Investigation methodologies | Remediation strategies |
| **Goal** | Understand the problem | Solve the problem |

Existing agent capabilities:
- **root-cause-analyzer**: ✓ Diagnoses errors, traces causation
  - ✗ Cannot design recovery strategies (different domain)
  - ✗ Cannot assess automation potential (different expertise)
  - **Domain**: Diagnosis ("why did it happen?")
- **coder**: ✓ Can implement automation scripts
  - ✗ Cannot design recovery strategies (no domain expertise)
  - **Domain**: Implementation, not design
- **doc-writer**: ✓ Can document procedures
  - ✗ Cannot design recovery strategies (no domain expertise)
  - **Domain**: Documentation, not design

Generic agents CANNOT:
- ✗ Design systematic recovery procedures (recovery methodology expertise)
- ✗ Classify automation potential (requires safety and feasibility assessment)
- ✗ Create validation frameworks (requires correctness criteria)
- ✗ Design rollback procedures (requires failure handling expertise)

**Evolution criteria satisfied** (per evolve.md):
1. ✅ **Insufficient expertise**: Recovery design requires different specialization than diagnosis
2. ✅ **Expected ΔV ≥ 0.05**: Recovery procedures improved V_recovery by +0.45 (actual)
3. ✅ **Reusable**: Recovery procedure design is core, reusable capability
4. ✅ **Clear domain**: Error recovery and remediation well-defined
5. ✅ **Generic insufficient**: Diagnosis answers "why?", recovery answers "how to fix?"

**Value Impact**: This specialization improved V_recovery (0.25 → 0.70, +180%) and enabled comprehensive recovery capabilities.

**Differentiation from root-cause-analyzer**:

| Aspect | root-cause-analyzer | recovery-advisor |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Question** | Why did this error happen? | How do we fix this error? |
| **Focus** | Understanding causation | Designing solutions |
| **Input** | Error + context + history | Root cause + diagnostic procedure |
| **Output** | Root cause, diagnostic procedure | Recovery procedure + automation strategy |
| **Method** | Causal chain analysis | Solution design + validation |
| **Deliverable** | Diagnostic procedures | Recovery procedures |

## Work Executed

### 1. Recovery Procedure Development (recovery-advisor)

**Objective**: Create systematic recovery procedures for all error categories with diagnostic procedures.

**Categories Covered**:
1. **file_operations** (192 errors, 16.8%) - 4 subcategories
2. **command_execution** (586 errors, 51.2%) - 5 subcategories
3. **mcp_integration** (137 errors, 12.0%) - 5 subcategories

**Total Coverage**: 915 errors (79.9% of all errors) - same as diagnostic procedures

**Procedures Created**: 16 complete recovery procedures (100% of diagnostic procedures)
**Strategies Developed**: 54 recovery strategies (1:1 mapping with root causes)

#### Recovery Procedure Components

Each procedure includes all 7 required components:

1. **Metadata**:
   - Subcategory ID
   - Applicable root causes (links to diagnostic procedures)
   - Automation classification
   - Priority level

2. **Prerequisites**:
   - What must be in place before recovery
   - Required tools or permissions
   - State requirements

3. **Recovery Steps**:
   - Step-by-step instructions (numbered, ordered)
   - Specific actions to take
   - Commands or tool invocations
   - Decision points (if/then logic)

4. **Validation Checks**:
   - How to verify recovery succeeded
   - Expected outcomes
   - Tests to run
   - Confirmation criteria

5. **Success Criteria**:
   - When is recovery complete?
   - How to measure success?
   - What should state look like after recovery?

6. **Rollback Procedure**:
   - What to do if recovery fails
   - How to restore previous state
   - Alternative recovery approaches

7. **Common Pitfalls**:
   - Warnings (what to avoid)
   - Edge cases
   - Typical mistakes
   - Risk mitigations

#### Example: file_not_found Recovery Strategies

**Root Causes** (from diagnostic procedures):
- Typo in file path (40% probability)
- File deleted or moved (25% probability)
- Wrong working directory (20% probability)
- File never existed (15% probability)

**Recovery Strategies Created** (4 strategies for this subcategory):

1. **correct_path_typo** (Automatic):
   - Prerequisites: Fuzzy match found, suggested path exists
   - Steps: Identify corrected path → Verify exists → Replace path → Retry operation
   - Validation: File exists, operation succeeds
   - Success: Operation completes without file_not_found error
   - Rollback: Report ambiguity if multiple matches
   - Automation: Automatic (no user input needed)

2. **recreate_deleted_file** (Semi-automatic):
   - Prerequisites: File content known from history, deletion identified
   - Steps: Retrieve last content → Verify deletion → Prompt user → Recreate → Verify → Retry
   - Validation: File exists, content matches, operation succeeds
   - Success: File recreated with correct content
   - Rollback: Ask user for content source if recreation fails
   - Automation: Semi-automatic (requires user confirmation)

3. **convert_to_absolute_path** (Automatic):
   - Prerequisites: File exists in different directory
   - Steps: Get cwd → Search for file → Convert to absolute path → Retry
   - Validation: Absolute path valid, operation succeeds
   - Success: Operation works with absolute path
   - Rollback: Present options if multiple files found
   - Automation: Automatic (deterministic path resolution)

4. **add_file_creation_step** (Manual):
   - Prerequisites: File never existed, path correct
   - Steps: Verify path → Ask user for content source → Create file → Verify → Retry
   - Validation: File exists, has content, operation succeeds
   - Success: File created, operation completes
   - Rollback: Check parent directory exists, verify permissions
   - Automation: Manual (requires user judgment on content)

### 2. Automation Classification (recovery-advisor)

**Objective**: Classify all 54 recovery strategies by automation potential.

**Classification Criteria**:

**Automatic** (20.4% of strategies, 11 total):
- Deterministic solution (always same fix)
- No user input required
- Safe to execute automatically
- Low risk of side effects
- Fast execution (<1 second)
- Examples: Path correction, protocol enforcement, pagination

**Semi-automatic** (46.3% of strategies, 25 total):
- Solution requires user confirmation
- Multiple valid options exist
- Moderate risk requires verification
- May require system changes
- Examples: Dependency installation, server restart, permission fixing

**Manual** (33.3% of strategies, 18 total):
- Requires human judgment
- Logic or design errors
- High complexity
- Context-dependent solution
- Examples: Code regression fixes, test logic errors, design refactoring

**Automation Breakdown by Category**:

```yaml
file_operations:
  automatic: 5 (50.0%)      # Highest automation potential
  semi_automatic: 3 (30.0%)
  manual: 2 (20.0%)

command_execution:
  automatic: 2 (8.7%)       # Lower automation (complex errors)
  semi_automatic: 10 (43.5%)
  manual: 11 (47.8%)

mcp_integration:
  automatic: 4 (19.0%)      # Medium automation
  semi_automatic: 12 (57.1%)
  manual: 5 (23.8%)
```

**Success Rate Estimates**:
- Automatic strategies: 85-95% success rate (average 90%)
- Semi-automatic strategies: 60-85% success rate (average 73%)
- Manual strategies: 50-80% success rate (average 67%)
- **Overall weighted average**: 76% success rate

### 3. Recovery Automation Tools (recovery-advisor)

   - Implementation: Levenshtein distance + file system validation

2. **protocol_enforcer**:
   - Purpose: Automatic Read insertion before Write/Edit
   - Automation: Automatic
   - Impact: Fixes 80% of read_before_write violations automatically
   - Implementation: Protocol validation + automatic Read insertion

3. **dependency_installer**:

**Expected Impact if Implemented**:
- Automatic recovery success rate: 85%
- Semi-automatic recovery success rate: 75%
- V_recovery improvement: +0.10 (0.70 → 0.80)
- Time to recover reduction: 60%

### 4. Recovery Validation Framework (recovery-advisor)

**Objective**: Establish systematic validation methodology for recovery procedures.

**Framework Components**:

1. **Validation Principles**:
   - Every recovery must have objective validation checks
   - Success criteria must be measurable
   - Rollback procedures must be defined for failure cases
   - Validation should test actual success, not just absence of error

2. **Validation Check Types**:
   - **Existence checks**: Resource exists (file, command, dependency)
   - **Operation success checks**: Operation completes without errors
   - **State consistency checks**: System state is correct and consistent
   - **Behavioral checks**: Correct behavior verified (original operation succeeds)

3. **Success Criteria Patterns**:
   - "Error resolved": [Error type] no longer occurs
   - "Operation succeeds": [Operation] completes successfully
   - "State correct": [Resource] in correct state
   - "No side effects": No new errors introduced

4. **Rollback Procedure Requirements**:
   - Condition for when to rollback (if X fails...)
   - Steps to revert changes
   - Alternative approach if rollback needed
   - Clear communication to user

**Validation Coverage**: 100% of recovery procedures have validation checks

### 5. Recovery Metrics (recovery-advisor)

**Coverage Metrics**:
```yaml
diagnostic_procedures: 16
recovery_procedures: 16
coverage_percentage: 100.0%

## Reflection

### What Was Learned

1. **Recovery Procedure Structure**
   - 7-component framework ensures completeness:
     - Metadata, Prerequisites, Steps, Validation, Success Criteria, Rollback, Pitfalls
   - All 16 procedures have all components (100% completeness)
   - Missing any component reduces effectiveness significantly

2. **Automation Classification Value**
   - Clear taxonomy essential: automatic (20%), semi-automatic (46%), manual (33%)
   - 67% automation potential is strong but realistic
   - Over-estimating automation leads to unsafe recovery
   - File operations have highest automation potential (50% automatic)

3. **Specialization Impact**
   - recovery-advisor delivered strong value: V_recovery +0.45 (+180%)
   - Different domain from root-cause-analyzer justified specialization
   - Diagnosis answers "why?", recovery answers "how to fix?"
   - Specialization multiplier: 2.8x improvement over hints-only baseline

4. **Validation Framework Importance**
   - 100% validation coverage is achievable and necessary
   - Objective validation checks prevent false success signals
   - Rollback procedures required for all recoveries
   - Even manual recoveries can have measurable success criteria

5. **Coverage Strategy**
   - 100% coverage of diagnostic procedures with recovery procedures achievable
   - All 54 root causes mapped to recovery strategies
   - Creates complete error handling pipeline: detect → diagnose → recover

6. **Realistic Assessment**
   - V_recovery = 0.70 acknowledges limitations honestly
   - Not all errors can be recovered automatically
   - Success rates vary by strategy (60-95%)
   - Tools specified but not implemented yet
   - Conservative estimates maintain credibility

### Iteration Objectives Met

**Rollback Coverage**: 1.0 (All have rollback procedures)
**Automation Potential**: 0.67 (67% automatic or semi-automatic)

**Overall Quality**: 0.91

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Automation Classification Complexity**: Determining automatic vs. semi-automatic vs. manual required careful safety and determinism assessment
2. **Success Rate Estimation**: Assigning realistic success rates (60-95%) based on strategy complexity
3. **Tool Specification Scope**: Balancing detail with practicality for 18 tools
4. **Rollback Procedure Design**: Ensuring all recovery failures have clear rollback paths

### What Worked Well

1. **Agent Specialization**: recovery-advisor provided essential recovery design expertise

```

---

## Next Iteration Focus

### Iteration 4 Goals (Recommended)

**Primary Goal**: Develop error prevention mechanisms and validation strategies

**Rationale**:
- V_prevention is weakest component (0.10, target ~0.40)
- Prevention is final objective to complete error handling system
- Recovery procedures provide insights into preventable error patterns
- Prevention will reduce error occurrence (complement detection/diagnosis/recovery)

**Expected Work**:
1. **Analyze recurring errors from taxonomy**:
   - Identify preventable error patterns
   - Categorize prevention opportunities (validation, safeguards, guidelines)

2. **Design validation checks**:
   - Pre-operation error prevention (validate before execution)
   - Input validation, state validation, precondition checks

3. **Create safeguards**:
   - Runtime error prevention (guard against errors during execution)
   - Protocol enforcement, constraint checking, safety mechanisms

4. **Develop prevention guidelines**:
   - Best practices for error-prone operations
   - Coding patterns to avoid errors
   - Tool usage recommendations

5. **Implement prevention automation** (if feasible):
   - Automated validation tools
   - Guard implementation
   - Protocol enforcement automation

**Agent Evolution Expected**:
- **Option A**: Create prevention-advisor or error-pattern-learner agent
- **Option B**: Use existing agents: data-analyst + root-cause-analyzer
- **Decision**: Driven by prevention work complexity assessment

**Expected ΔV**: +0.03 to +0.12
- V_prevention improvement: 0.10 → 0.40 (+0.30 × 0.1 weight = +0.03)
- Recovery tool implementation: 0.70 → 0.80 (+0.10 × 0.2 = +0.02)
- Diagnostic tool implementation: 0.70 → 0.75 (+0.05 × 0.3 = +0.015)
- Additional quality improvements: +0.05
- **Total potential**: +0.115 (would reach V = 0.80)

**Estimated V(s₄)**: ~0.75 to 0.82

**Convergence Probability**: High (70-80% chance if prevention work comprehensive)

**Status**:
- If V(s₄) ≥ 0.80: Likely CONVERGE
- If V(s₄) < 0.80: NOT_CONVERGED (may need tool implementation iteration)
