# Error Pattern Analysis - Iteration 0
# Generated: 2025-10-14
# Source: data/error-history.jsonl (1,145 errors analyzed)

## Pattern Categories (Initial Hypothesis)

Based on analysis of 654 unique error types across 1,145 error instances:

### 1. File Access Errors (High Frequency: ~18%)
   - "File does not exist" (101 occurrences, 8.82%)
   - "File has not been read yet. Read it first before writing" (57 occurrences, 4.98%)
   - "File content exceeds maximum allowed tokens" (7 occurrences, 0.61%)
   
   **Pattern**: File system access violations, missing files, and read-before-write protocol violations
   **Impact**: Blocks file operations, requires manual intervention
   **Tools Affected**: Read (184 errors, 5.3% rate), Write (30 errors, 4.32% rate), Edit (101 errors, 4.06% rate)

### 2. MCP/Integration Errors (High Frequency: ~12%)
   - "MCP error -32603: jq filter error" (47 occurrences, 4.10%)
   - "MCP error -32603: Tool execution failed" (21 occurrences, 1.83%)
   - "MCP error -32603: meta-cc error" (10 occurrences, 0.87%)
   - "MCP error -32001: Session not found" (8 occurrences, 0.70%)
   - "MCP error -32000: Connection closed" (5 occurrences, 0.44%)
   - jq parse errors: "Invalid numeric literal", "invalid JSON", "unexpected end of JSON input" (multiple)
   
   **Pattern**: MCP tool integration failures, jq query syntax errors, session management issues
   **Impact**: Breaks meta-cognition queries, disrupts analysis workflows
   **Root Causes**: Invalid jq expressions, JSON parsing issues, session state problems

### 3. Command Execution Errors (Moderate Frequency: ~9%)
   - Generic "Error" (50 occurrences, 4.37%)
   - Bash syntax errors: "unexpected end of file" (5 occurrences, 0.44%)
   - "meta-cc: command not found" (4 occurrences, 0.35%)
   - "command failed with exit code" (5 occurrences, 0.44%)
   
   **Pattern**: Command execution failures, shell syntax errors, missing binaries
   **Impact**: Workflow interruptions, requires command retry
   **Tools Affected**: Bash (586 errors, 7.61% rate - highest error rate among major tools)

### 4. User Interruption (Low Frequency: ~3%)
   - "[Request interrupted by user for tool use]" (28 occurrences, 2.45%)
   - "The user doesn't want to take this action right now" (7 occurrences, 0.61%)
   
   **Pattern**: User-initiated interruptions during tool execution
   **Impact**: Task abandonment, requires restart
   **Tools Affected**: Task (26 errors, 8.93% rate - highest error rate overall)

### 5. Resource/Capacity Errors (Low Frequency: ~1%)
   - "Streaming fallback triggered" (11 occurrences, 0.96%)
   - "File content exceeds maximum allowed tokens" (7 occurrences, 0.61%)
   
   **Pattern**: Resource limits exceeded (tokens, memory, etc.)
   **Impact**: Degraded functionality, fallback to less efficient methods

## Error Frequency Distribution

High-frequency errors (>10 occurrences):
1. File does not exist: 101
2. File not read before write: 57
3. Generic "Error": 50
4. jq filter error (invalid expression): 47
5. User interruption: 28
6. MCP tool execution failed: 21

These 6 patterns account for ~30% of all errors (304/1145)

## Tool-Specific Error Characteristics

### Bash (586 errors, 51% of all errors)
   - Highest absolute error count
   - Error rate: 7.61% (above average)
   - Common issues: Command not found, syntax errors, execution failures
   - Severity: High (blocks automation and system operations)

### Read (184 errors, 16% of all errors)
   - Second highest absolute error count
   - Error rate: 5.30% (near average)
   - Common issues: File does not exist, file access violations
   - Severity: Moderate (blocks file reading but often recoverable)

### Edit (101 errors, 9% of all errors)
   - Third highest absolute error count
   - Error rate: 4.06% (below average)
   - Common issues: File does not exist, edit conflicts
   - Severity: Moderate (blocks file editing)

### Task (26 errors, 2% of all errors)
   - Low absolute error count
   - Error rate: 8.93% (highest rate among major tools)
   - Common issues: User interruptions, task failures
   - Severity: High (breaks agent invocation and coordination)

### MCP Tools (varied)
   - Distributed across many MCP tools
   - Common issues: jq errors, session errors, connection issues
   - Severity: High (breaks meta-cognition capabilities)

## Impact Assessment

### Blocking Errors (~40%)
   - File access errors: Prevent file operations until resolved
   - Command execution failures: Block automation
   - Task interruptions: Prevent agent coordination

### Degrading Errors (~20%)
   - MCP tool failures: Reduce meta-cognition capability
   - Resource limit errors: Force fallback to less efficient methods

### Recoverable Errors (~35%)
   - User interruptions: Intentional, can restart
   - Transient failures: May succeed on retry

### Silent/Unknown (~5%)
   - Generic "Error" messages: No diagnostic information
   - Unclassified errors: Require investigation

## Temporal Patterns

(Note: Full temporal analysis requires timestamp analysis, deferred to next iteration)

Initial observations:
- No obvious time-of-day clustering detected
- Error distribution appears consistent across project lifetime
- Some error types may be phase-specific (e.g., early setup vs. later development)

## Cascading Failure Patterns

Observed sequences (from tool-sequences.jsonl):
- Read → Edit failure chains (file access errors)
- MCP query → jq error chains (query syntax issues)
- Bash → Bash retry chains (command failures)

(Detailed cascade analysis deferred to next iteration)

## Key Insights

1. **File Access Dominates**: File-related errors (Read, Write, Edit) account for ~30% of all errors
2. **Bash is Error-Prone**: 51% of errors come from Bash commands, highest error rate (7.61%)
3. **MCP Integration Fragile**: jq query errors are frequent (4.10%), suggest syntax validation needed
4. **Task Coordination Risky**: Task tool has highest error rate (8.93%), though low volume
5. **Taxonomy Gaps**: 654 unique error types suggest need for classification system

## Gaps Identified

### Detection Gaps
- No error categorization system exists
- Cannot distinguish error severity automatically
- No real-time error monitoring

### Diagnosis Gaps
- 654 unique error types, no root cause analysis
- Generic "Error" messages provide no diagnostic information (50 cases)
- No systematic diagnostic procedures

### Recovery Gaps
- No documented recovery procedures for any error type
- No automated recovery mechanisms
- Manual fixes only, no knowledge capture

### Prevention Gaps
- No proactive error prevention
- No input validation for jq queries
- No file existence checks before Read/Edit/Write
- No retry logic for transient failures

## Priorities for Next Iteration

Based on frequency × impact:

1. **Critical**: File access error handling (18% frequency, blocking impact)
2. **High**: Bash command error recovery (51% of errors, automation critical)
3. **High**: MCP/jq query validation (12% frequency, breaks meta-cognition)
4. **Medium**: Task coordination resilience (low volume, high impact)
5. **Medium**: Error taxonomy development (enables systematic handling)

## Notes

- This is an initial, hypothesis-driven pattern analysis
- Patterns will be refined as error taxonomy is developed
- Some error categories may overlap or require reclassification
- Full root cause analysis requires deeper investigation (next iteration)
