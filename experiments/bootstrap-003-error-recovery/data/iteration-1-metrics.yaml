    # Detection Component
    V_detection:
      previous_s0: 0.50
      current_s1: 0.80
      delta: +0.30
      improvement: 60%
      rationale: |
        Comprehensive taxonomy provides systematic classification:
        - 100% error coverage (1145/1145 classified)
        - 7 top-level categories with clear boundaries
        - 25 subcategories for detailed classification
        - 17 classification rules for automation
        - 4 severity levels with clear criteria
        - Pattern-based classification enables recognition
        Detection is now systematic and complete, not just passive logging.

    # Diagnosis Component
    V_diagnosis:
      previous_s0: 0.30
      current_s1: 0.35
      delta: +0.05
      improvement: 17%
      rationale: |
        Taxonomy provides foundation for diagnosis:
        - Error categories suggest likely causes
        - Severity assessment guides investigation priority
        - Pattern recognition aids root cause identification
        However, systematic diagnostic procedures don't exist yet.
        Improvement is modest - taxonomy enables but doesn't implement diagnosis.

    # Recovery Component
    V_recovery:
      previous_s0: 0.20
      current_s1: 0.20
      delta: 0.00
      improvement: 0%
      rationale: |
        No change - taxonomy is prerequisite but doesn't provide recovery.
        - No recovery procedures documented yet
        - No automation implemented
        - Category structure will guide future recovery strategies
        Recovery work belongs in Iteration 2.

    # Prevention Component
    V_prevention:
      previous_s0: 0.10
      current_s1: 0.10
      delta: 0.00
      improvement: 0%
      rationale: |
        No change - taxonomy doesn't add prevention mechanisms.
        - No validation checks implemented
        - No proactive safeguards added
        - Categories identify preventable errors for future work
        Prevention work belongs in Iteration 3+.
