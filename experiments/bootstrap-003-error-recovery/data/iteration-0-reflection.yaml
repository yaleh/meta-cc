  gap: 0.46
  percentage_to_target: 42.5%

gaps_identified:
  detection:
    - "No error categorization system"
    - "654 unique error types, no taxonomy"
    - "Cannot distinguish severity automatically"
  
  diagnosis:
    - "No systematic diagnostic procedures"
    - "Generic 'Error' messages (4.37%) provide no information"
    - "Manual root cause analysis only"
  
  recovery:
    - "No documented recovery procedures"
    - "No recovery automation"
    - "No knowledge capture from fixes"
  
  prevention:
    - "No proactive prevention mechanisms"
    - "No input validation (jq, file existence)"
    - "No retry logic for transient failures"

priorities_for_iteration_1:
  primary:
    goal: "Develop error taxonomy and classification system"
    rationale: "Foundational for systematic error handling"
    expected_delta_V: 0.20
    expected_V_s1: 0.54
  
  agent_evolution_needed:
    create: error-classifier
    reason: "Generic data-analyst lacks error domain expertise"
    specialization: "Error categorization and taxonomy development"
  
  meta_agent_evolution_needed: no
  rationale: "M₀ capabilities sufficient for taxonomy development"

convergence_assessment:
  converged: no
  reason: "Baseline only, V(s₀) = 0.34 < 0.80"
  iterations_needed_estimate: 4-6
  
  criteria_status:
    meta_agent_stable: "N/A (initial)"
    agent_set_stable: "N/A (initial)"
    value_threshold: "No (0.34 < 0.80)"
    task_objectives: "No (not started)"

learnings:
  methodology:
    - "OCA framework applied successfully (Observe phase complete)"
    - "Value function calculation provides honest baseline"
    - "Gap identification drives prioritization effectively"
  
  error_landscape:
    - "Bash errors dominate (51%), highest absolute count"
    - "File access errors critical (18%), blocking impact"
    - "MCP/jq errors frequent (12%), break meta-cognition"
    - "654 unique error types indicate high diversity"
  
  system_state:
    - "Detection is passive (logged but not organized)"
    - "Diagnosis is manual (no procedures or tools)"
    - "Recovery is ad-hoc (no documentation or automation)"
    - "Prevention is non-existent (entirely reactive)"

next_steps:
  immediate:
    - "Proceed to Iteration 1: Error Taxonomy Development"
    - "Create error-classifier specialized agent"
    - "Classify 1,145 errors into taxonomy"
    - "Calculate V(s₁) after classification"
  
  estimated_effort:
