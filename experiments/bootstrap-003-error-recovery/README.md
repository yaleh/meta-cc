# Bootstrap-003: Error Recovery Methodology

**Framework**: BAIME (Bootstrapped AI Methodology Engineering)
**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Domain**: Error Detection, Diagnosis, and Recovery

---

## Overview

This experiment applies the BAIME framework to develop a systematic error recovery methodology through observation of agent error handling patterns in the meta-cc project. The experiment uses the complete three-layer architecture (bootstrapped-se + empirical-methodology + value-optimization) to achieve both task completion and methodology development.

**Previous execution**: Converged at V(s₄) ≥ 0.80 in 5 iterations (0-4) with 85% reusability
**This execution**: Re-implementing with explicit BAIME framework integration

## Objectives

### Meta-Objective (Methodology Development Layer)

**Develop systematic error recovery methodology through observation of agent error handling patterns**

Apply BAIME's OCA cycle:
- **Observe**: Collect data on error patterns, failure modes, recovery attempts
- **Codify**: Extract patterns into reusable error recovery methodology
- **Automate**: Create tools and checks for error detection and recovery automation

**Expected Output**: (O, Aₙ, Mₙ)
- O = Error recovery methodology and reduced error rate
- Aₙ = Converged agent set (generic or specialized for error domains)
- Mₙ = Meta-Agent M₀ (may evolve for error-specific coordination)

### Instance Objective (Task Execution Layer)

**Reduce error rate and improve error recovery for meta-cc project**

**Target**: Error-prone code areas across `internal/` and `cmd/` packages

**Scope**:
- Achieve error detection coverage ≥90% of failure modes
- Implement systematic error classification taxonomy
- Create root cause diagnosis procedures for common error types
- Establish recovery strategy patterns (≥5 patterns)
- Reduce error rate from baseline to <2%

**Deliverables**:
- Error classification taxonomy (≥10 error categories)
- Root cause diagnosis procedures (≥5 diagnostic workflows)
- Recovery strategy patterns (≥5 recovery patterns)
- Prevention guidelines (≥8 prevention practices)
- Automated error detection tools
- Error recovery automation where feasible

## Value Functions

### V_instance: Error Recovery Implementation Quality

```
V_instance(s) = 0.35·V_detection +        -- Error detection coverage
                0.30·V_diagnosis +        -- Diagnostic effectiveness
                0.20·V_recovery +         -- Recovery success rate
                0.15·V_prevention         -- Prevention effectiveness
```

**Component Definitions**:

1. **V_detection** (Error Detection Coverage):
   - 1.0: ≥95% of failure modes detected, comprehensive monitoring
   - 0.8: ≥85% coverage, good monitoring, some gaps
   - 0.6: ≥70% coverage, basic monitoring
   - 0.4: ≥50% coverage, significant gaps
   - <0.4: <50% coverage, inadequate

2. **V_diagnosis** (Diagnostic Effectiveness):
   - 1.0: Root cause identified in >90% of cases, <5 min diagnosis time
   - 0.8: >75% root cause identification, <15 min diagnosis
   - 0.6: >60% identification, <30 min diagnosis
   - 0.4: >40% identification, slow diagnosis
   - <0.4: <40% identification, diagnosis unreliable

3. **V_recovery** (Recovery Success Rate):
   - 1.0: >90% automated recovery, <1 min recovery time
   - 0.8: >75% recovery (manual or automated), <5 min
   - 0.6: >60% recovery, <15 min
   - 0.4: >40% recovery, slow or manual intensive
   - <0.4: <40% recovery, many failures unrecoverable

   - 0.6: >40% reduction, some prevention
   - 0.4: >20% reduction, minimal prevention
   - <0.4: <20% reduction, inadequate prevention

### V_meta: Error Recovery Methodology Quality

```
V_meta(s) = 0.40·V_methodology_completeness +    -- Documentation quality
            0.30·V_methodology_effectiveness +   -- Practical impact
            0.30·V_methodology_reusability       -- Transferability
```

**Component Definitions** (Universal BAIME rubrics):

1. **V_methodology_completeness**:
   - 1.0: Complete process + criteria + examples + edge cases + rationale
   - 0.8: Complete workflow + criteria, missing examples/edge cases
   - 0.6: Step-by-step procedures, missing decision criteria
   - <0.6: Observational notes only, no structured process

2. **V_methodology_effectiveness**:
   - 1.0: >10x speedup vs ad-hoc, >50% error rate reduction
   - 0.8: 5-10x speedup, 20-50% error rate reduction
   - 0.6: 2-5x speedup, 10-20% error rate reduction
   - <0.6: <2x speedup, no measurable error rate improvement

3. **V_methodology_reusability**:
   - 1.0: <15% modification needed, nearly universal across error domains
   - 0.8: 15-40% modification, minor tweaks for different error types
   - 0.6: 40-70% modification, some adaptation needed
   - <0.6: >70% modification, highly specialized to specific errors

## Convergence Criteria

**Standard Dual Convergence** (expected pattern):

```
CONVERGED iff:
  1. V_instance(s_n) ≥ 0.80        -- Error recovery quality threshold
  2. V_meta(s_n) ≥ 0.80            -- Methodology quality threshold
  3. M_n == M_{n-1}                -- Meta-Agent stable
  4. A_n == A_{n-1}                -- Agent set stable
  5. ΔV_instance < 0.02 (2+ iters) -- Instance convergence
  6. ΔV_meta < 0.02 (2+ iters)     -- Meta convergence
```

**Expected Iterations**: 4-6 (based on medium-high domain complexity)

**Alternative Convergence Patterns**:
- **Practical Convergence**: If error rate reduction and methodology quality evidence exceeds metrics
- **Meta-Focused Convergence**: If V_meta ≥ 0.80 and methodology is primary value

**Note from Previous Execution**: Meta-Agent capabilities may evolve for error-specific coordination (Mₙ ≠ M₀ is acceptable if justified)

## Data Sources

### Observation Tools (meta-cc MCP)

```bash
# Error pattern analysis
meta-cc query-tools --status error > data/error-tool-calls.jsonl

# Error-prone files (high error frequency)
meta-cc query-tools --status error --tool Edit > data/error-prone-edits.jsonl
meta-cc query-tools --status error --tool Bash > data/error-prone-bash.jsonl

# Error-related conversations (understand user pain points)
meta-cc query-user-messages --pattern "error|fail|bug|issue|problem|fix" \
  > data/error-conversations.jsonl

# Tool sequences leading to errors
meta-cc query-tool-sequences --pattern ".*error.*" > data/error-sequences.jsonl

# Error context (surrounding tool calls)
meta-cc query-context --error-signature "<pattern>" --window 3 \
  > data/error-context.jsonl

# Session statistics (overall error rate)
meta-cc get-session-stats > data/session-stats.jsonl
```

### Baseline Metrics

Current state (to be measured in Iteration 0):
- Overall error rate: TBD (target: <2%)
- Error categories: TBD (classify by type)
- Most common error types: TBD
- Error-prone tools: TBD
- Error-prone files: TBD
- Mean time to diagnosis (MTTD): TBD
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR): TBD
- Recovery success rate: TBD

## Expected Agents

Based on BAIME principles (let specialization emerge from data):

**Initial agents** (generic, from M₀):
- data-analyst: Analyze error patterns and statistics
- doc-writer: Document error recovery procedures
- coder: Implement error handling improvements

**Potential specialized agents** (create only if needed):
- error-classifier: Classify errors into taxonomy categories
- root-cause-analyzer: Perform root cause analysis for errors
- recovery-strategist: Design recovery strategies for error types
- prevention-advisor: Recommend preventive measures

**Decision criteria**: Create specialized agent only when:
- Generic agents insufficient (demonstrated over 2+ iterations)
- Error domain complexity requires specialized knowledge
- Specialization provides >2x efficiency gain in error handling
- Pattern will be reused across multiple error types

**Note from Previous Execution**: Specialized agents (classification, diagnosis, recovery) were valuable; expect similar emergence

## Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks**:
- High error diversity may require extensive taxonomy
- Some errors may be inherently unrecoverable (system limits)
- Automated recovery may introduce new failure modes

**Mitigation**:
- Start with common error types (80/20 rule)
- Focus on high-impact, high-frequency errors first
- Thoroughly test automated recovery before deploying

**Methodology Risks**:
- Over-classification (too granular taxonomy)
- Under-classification (missing important categories)
- Prevention practices too restrictive (reduce productivity)

**Mitigation**:
- Use value function to guide taxonomy granularity
- Validate taxonomy with real error data
- Balance prevention with development velocity
