# Hook Scripts

Custom hook scripts called by the pre-commit framework.

## Overview

This directory contains auxiliary scripts that are executed by the pre-commit framework
(configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`), **NOT** directly installed to `.git/hooks/`.

## Scripts

### plugin-version-bump.sh

**Purpose:** Auto-increment plugin version when .claude/ files are modified

**Triggered by:** Changes to `.claude/commands/*.md` or `.claude/agents/*.md`

**Behavior:**
- Detects plugin file changes during `git commit`
- Automatically bumps patch version (e.g., 2.0.0 â†’ 2.0.1)
- Updates `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`
- Stages version files automatically

**Configuration:**
- Called by: `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (plugin-version-bump hook)
- Requires: `jq` command-line JSON processor

## Usage

These scripts are executed automatically by the pre-commit framework.
You don't need to run them manually.

To set up pre-commit hooks:

```bash
# Install pre-commit (if not already installed)
pip install pre-commit
# or
brew install pre-commit

# Install hooks
pre-commit install
```

## Development

When modifying these scripts:

1. Edit the script directly
2. Test with: `pre-commit run plugin-version-bump --all-files`
3. Commit changes: scripts are version controlled

## Important Notes

- These scripts are **NOT** Git hooks in the traditional sense
- They are **NOT** installed via `git config core.hooksPath`
- They are called by the pre-commit framework as configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- The actual Git hook is `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (auto-generated by pre-commit framework)
