# Pattern: Problem-Solution Structure

**Status**: ✅ Validated (2+ uses)
**Domain**: Documentation (especially troubleshooting and diagnostic guides)
**Transferability**: Universal (applies to all problem-solving documentation)

---

## Problem

Users come to documentation with problems, not abstract interest in features. Traditional feature-first documentation makes users hunt for solutions.

**Symptoms**:
- Users can't find answers to "How do I fix X?" questions
- Documentation organized by feature, not by problem
- Troubleshooting sections are afterthoughts (if they exist)
- No systematic diagnostic guidance

---

## Solution

Structure documentation around problems and their solutions, not features and capabilities.

**Pattern**: Problem → Diagnosis → Solution → Prevention

**Key Principle**: Start with user's problem state (symptoms), guide to root cause (diagnosis), provide actionable solution, then show how to prevent recurrence.

---

## Implementation

### Basic Structure

```markdown
## Problem: [User's Issue]

**Symptoms**: [Observable signs user experiences]

**Example**: [Concrete manifestation of the problem]

---

**Diagnosis**: [How to identify root cause]

**Common Causes**:
1. [Cause 1] - [How to verify]
2. [Cause 2] - [How to verify]
3. [Cause 3] - [How to verify]

---

**Solution**:

[For Each Cause]:
**If [Cause]**:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Verify fix worked]

---

**Prevention**: [How to avoid this problem in future]
```

### Example: From BAIME Guide Troubleshooting

```markdown
## Problem: Value scores not improving

**Symptoms**: V_instance or V_meta stuck or decreasing across iterations

**Example**:
```
Iteration 0: V_instance = 0.35, V_meta = 0.25
Iteration 1: V_instance = 0.37, V_meta = 0.28  (minimal progress)
Iteration 2: V_instance = 0.34, V_meta = 0.30  (instance decreased!)
```

---

**Diagnosis**: Identify root cause of stagnation

**Common Causes**:

1. **Solving symptoms, not problems**
   - Verify: Are you addressing surface issues or root causes?
   - Example: "Low test coverage" (symptom) vs "No systematic testing strategy" (root cause)

2. **Incorrect value function definition**
   - Verify: Do components actually measure quality?
   - Example: Coverage % alone doesn't capture test quality

3. **Working on wrong priorities**
   - Verify: Are you addressing highest-impact gaps?
   - Example: Fixing grammar when structure is unclear

---

**Solution**:

**If Solving Symptoms**:
1. Re-analyze problems in iteration-N.md section 9
2. Identify root causes (not symptoms)
3. Focus next iteration on root cause solutions

**Example**:
```
❌ Problem: "Low test coverage" → Solution: "Write more tests"
✅ Problem: "No systematic testing strategy" → Solution: "Create TDD workflow pattern"
```

**If Incorrect Value Function**:
1. Review V_instance/V_meta component definitions
2. Ensure components measure actual quality, not proxies
3. Recalculate scores with corrected definitions

**If Wrong Priorities**:
1. Use gap analysis in evaluation section
2. Prioritize by impact (∆V potential)
3. Defer low-impact items

---

**Prevention**:

1. **Problem analysis before solution**: Spend 20% of iteration time on diagnosis
2. **Root cause identification**: Ask "why" 5 times to find true problem
3. **Impact-based prioritization**: Calculate potential ∆V for each gap
4. **Value function validation**: Ensure components measure real quality

---

**Success Indicators** (how to know fix worked):
- Next iteration shows meaningful progress (∆V ≥ 0.05)
- Problems addressed are root causes, not symptoms
- Value function components correlate with actual quality
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start With User-Facing Symptoms

**Good** (User Perspective):
```markdown
**Symptoms**: My tests keep failing with "fixture not found" errors
```

**Less Effective** (System Perspective):
```markdown
**Problem**: Fixture loading mechanism is broken
```

**Why**: Users experience symptoms, not internal system states. Starting with symptoms meets users where they are.

### 2. Provide Multiple Root Causes

**Good** (Comprehensive Diagnosis):
```markdown
**Common Causes**:
1. Fixture file missing (check path)
2. Fixture in wrong directory (check structure)
3. Fixture name misspelled (check spelling)
```

**Less Effective** (Single Cause):
```markdown
**Cause**: File not found
```

**Why**: Same symptom can have multiple root causes. Comprehensive diagnosis helps users identify their specific issue.

### 3. Include Concrete Examples

**Good** (Concrete):
```markdown
**Example**:
```
Iteration 0: V_instance = 0.35
Iteration 1: V_instance = 0.37 (+0.02, minimal)
```
```

**Less Effective** (Abstract):
```markdown
**Example**: Value scores show little improvement
```

**Why**: Concrete examples help users recognize their situation ("Yes, that's exactly what I'm seeing!")

### 4. Provide Verification Steps

**Good** (Verifiable):
```markdown
**Diagnosis**: Check if value function components measure real quality
**Verify**: Do test coverage improvements correlate with actual test quality?
**Test**: Lower coverage with better tests should score higher than high coverage with brittle tests
```

**Less Effective** (Unverifiable):
```markdown
**Diagnosis**: Value function might be wrong
```

**Why**: Users need concrete steps to verify diagnosis, not just vague possibilities.

### 5. Include Success Indicators

**Good** (Measurable):
```markdown
**Success Indicators**:
- Next iteration shows ∆V ≥ 0.05 (meaningful progress)
- Problems addressed are root causes
- Value scores correlate with perceived quality
```

**Less Effective** (Vague):
```markdown
**Success**: Things get better
```

**Why**: Users need to know fix worked. Concrete indicators provide confidence.

### 6. Document Prevention, Not Just Solution

**Good** (Preventive):
```markdown
**Solution**: [Fix current problem]
**Prevention**: Add automated test to catch this class of errors
```

**Less Effective** (Reactive):
```markdown
**Solution**: [Fix current problem]
```

**Why**: Prevention reduces future support burden and improves user experience.

## Variations

### Variation 1: Decision Tree Diagnosis

**Use For**: Complex problems with many potential causes

**Structure**:
```markdown
**Diagnosis Decision Tree**:

Is V_instance improving?
├─ Yes → Check V_meta (see below)
└─ No → Is work addressing root causes?
    ├─ Yes → Check value function definition
    └─ No → Re-prioritize based on gap analysis
```

**Example from BAIME Troubleshooting**: Value score improvement decision tree

### Variation 2: Before/After Solutions

**Use For**: Demonstrating fix impact

**Structure**:
```markdown
**Before** (Problem State):
[Code/config/state showing problem]

**After** (Solution State):
[Code/config/state after fix]

**Impact**: [Measurable improvement]
```

**Example**:
```markdown
**Before**:
```python
V_instance = 0.37  # Vague calculation
```

**After**:
```python
V_instance = (Coverage + Quality + Maintainability) / 3
           = (0.40 + 0.25 + 0.40) / 3
           = 0.35
```

**Impact**: +0.20 accuracy through explicit component breakdown
```

### Variation 3: Symptom-Cause Matrix

**Use For**: Multiple symptoms mapping to overlapping causes

**Structure**: Table mapping symptoms to likely causes

**Example**:

| Symptom | Likely Cause 1 | Likely Cause 2 | Likely Cause 3 |
|---------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| V stuck | Wrong priorities | Incorrect value function | Solving symptoms |
| V decreasing | New penalties discovered | Honest reassessment | System evolution broke deliverable |

### Variation 4: Diagnostic Workflow

**Use For**: Systematic problem investigation

**Structure**: Step-by-step investigation process

**Example from Error Recovery**:
1. **Symptom identification**: What error occurred?
2. **Context gathering**: When? Where? Under what conditions?
3. **Root cause analysis**: Why did it occur? (5 Whys)
4. **Solution selection**: Which recovery pattern applies?
5. **Implementation**: Apply solution with verification
6. **Prevention**: Add safeguards to prevent recurrence

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Starting With Solution Instead of Problem

**Bad**:
```markdown
## Use This New Feature

[Feature explanation]
```

**Good**:
```markdown
## Problem: Can't Quickly Reference Commands

**Symptoms**: Spend 5+ minutes searching docs for syntax

**Solution**: Use Quick Reference (this new feature)
```

**Why**: Users care about solving problems, not learning features for their own sake.

### Mistake 2: Diagnosis Without Verification Steps

**Bad**:
```markdown
**Diagnosis**: Value function might be wrong
```

**Good**:
```markdown
**Diagnosis**: Value function definition incorrect
**Verify**:
1. Review component definitions
2. Test: Do component scores correlate with perceived quality?
3. Check: Would high-quality deliverable score high?
```

**Why**: Users need concrete steps to confirm diagnosis.

### Mistake 3: Solution Without Context

**Bad**:
```markdown
**Solution**: Recalculate V_instance with corrected formula
```

**Good**:
```markdown
**Solution** (If value function definition incorrect):
1. Review V_instance component definitions in iteration-0.md
2. Ensure components measure actual quality (not proxies)
3. Recalculate all historical scores with corrected definition
4. Update system-state.md with corrected values
```

**Why**: Context-free solutions are hard to apply correctly.

### Mistake 4: No Prevention Guidance

**Bad**: Only provides fix for current problem

**Good**: Provides fix + prevention strategy

**Why**: Prevention reduces recurring issues and support burden.
