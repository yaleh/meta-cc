# Pattern: Example-Driven Explanation

**Status**: ✅ Validated (2+ uses)
**Domain**: Documentation
**Transferability**: Universal (applies to all conceptual documentation)

---

## Problem

Abstract concepts are hard to understand without concrete instantiation. Theoretical explanations alone don't stick—readers need to see concepts in action.

**Symptoms**:
- Users say "I understand the words but not what it means"
- Concepts explained but users can't apply them
- Documentation feels academic, not practical
- No clear path from theory to practice

---

## Solution

Pair every abstract concept with a concrete example. Show don't tell.

**Pattern**: Abstract Definition + Concrete Example = Clarity

**Key Principle**: The example should be immediately recognizable and relatable. Prefer real-world code/scenarios over toy examples.

---

## Implementation

### Basic Structure

```markdown
## Concept Name

**Definition**: [Abstract explanation of what it is]

**Example**: [Concrete instance showing concept in action]

**Why It Matters**: [Impact or benefit in practice]
```

### Example: From BAIME Guide

**Concept**: Dual Value Functions

**Definition** (Abstract):
```
BAIME uses two independent value functions:
- V_instance: Domain-specific deliverable quality
- V_meta: Methodology quality and reusability
```

**Example** (Concrete):
```
Testing Methodology Experiment:

V_instance (Testing Quality):
- Coverage: 0.85 (85% code coverage achieved)
- Quality: 0.80 (TDD workflow, systematic patterns)
- Maintainability: 0.90 (automated test generation)
→ V_instance = (0.85 + 0.80 + 0.90) / 3 = 0.85

V_meta (Methodology Quality):
- Completeness: 0.80 (patterns extracted, automation created)
- Reusability: 0.85 (89% transferable to other Go projects)
- Validation: 0.90 (validated across 3 projects)
→ V_meta = (0.80 + 0.85 + 0.90) / 3 = 0.85
```

**Why It Matters**: Dual metrics ensure both deliverable quality AND methodology reusability, not just one.

## When to Use

### Use This Pattern For

✅ **Abstract concepts** (architecture patterns, design principles)
✅ **Technical formulas** (value functions, algorithms)
✅ **Theoretical frameworks** (BAIME, OCA cycle)
✅ **Domain-specific terminology** (meta-agent, capabilities)
✅ **Multi-step processes** (iteration workflow, convergence)

### Don't Use For

❌ **Concrete procedures** (installation steps, CLI commands) - these ARE examples
❌ **Simple definitions** (obvious terms don't need examples)
❌ **Lists and enumerations** (example would be redundant)

---

## Validation Evidence

**Use 1: BAIME Core Concepts** (Iteration 0)
- 6 concepts explained: Value Functions, OCA Cycle, Meta-Agent, Agents, Capabilities, Convergence
- Each concept: Abstract definition + Concrete example
- Pattern emerged naturally from complexity management
- **Result**: Users understand abstract BAIME framework through testing methodology example

**Use 2: Quick Reference Template** (Iteration 2)
- Command documentation pattern: Syntax + Example + Output
- Every command paired with concrete usage example
- Decision trees show abstract logic + concrete scenarios
- **Result**: Reference docs provide both structure and instantiation

**Use 3: Error Recovery Example** (Iteration 3)
- Each iteration step: Abstract progress + Concrete value scores
- Diagnostic workflow: Pattern description + Actual error classification
- Recovery patterns: Concept + Implementation code
- **Result**: Abstract methodology becomes concrete through domain-specific examples

**Pattern Validated**: ✅ 3 uses across BAIME guide creation, template development, second domain example

## Best Practices

### 1. Example First, Then Abstraction

**Good** (Example → Pattern):
```markdown
**Example**: Error Recovery Iteration 1
- Created 8 diagnostic workflows
- Expanded taxonomy to 13 categories
- V_instance jumped from 0.40 to 0.62 (+0.22)

**Pattern**: Rich baseline data accelerates convergence.
Iteration 1 progress was 2x typical because historical errors
provided immediate validation context.
```

**Less Effective** (Pattern → Example):
```markdown
**Pattern**: Rich baseline data accelerates convergence.

**Example**: In error recovery, having 1,336 historical errors
enabled faster iteration.
```

**Why**: Leading with concrete example makes abstract pattern immediately grounded.

### 2. Use Real Examples, Not Toy Examples

**Good** (Real):
```markdown
**Example**: meta-cc JSONL output
```json
{"TurnCount": 2676, "ToolCallCount": 1012, "ErrorRate": 0}
```
```

**Less Effective** (Toy):
```markdown
**Example**: Simple object
```json
{"field1": "value1", "field2": 123}
```
```

**Why**: Real examples show actual complexity and edge cases users will encounter.

### 3. Multiple Examples Show Transferability

**Single Example**: Shows pattern works once
**2-3 Examples**: Shows pattern transfers across contexts
**5+ Examples**: Shows pattern is universal

**BAIME Guide**: 10+ jq examples in JSONL reference prove pattern universality

### 4. Example Complexity Matches Concept Complexity

**Simple Concept** → Simple Example
- "JSONL is newline-delimited JSON" → One-line example: `{"key": "value"}\n`

**Complex Concept** → Detailed Example
- "Dual value functions with independent scoring" → Full calculation breakdown with component scores

### 5. Annotate Examples

**Good** (Annotated):
```markdown
```bash
meta-cc parse stats --output md
```

**Output**:
```markdown
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Turn Count | 2,676 |  ← Total conversation turns
| Tool Calls | 1,012 |  ← Number of tool invocations
```
```

**Why**: Annotations explain non-obvious elements, making example self-contained.

## Variations

### Variation 1: Before/After Examples

**Use For**: Demonstrating improvement, refactoring, optimization

**Structure**:
```markdown
**Before**: [Problem state]
**After**: [Solution state]
**Impact**: [Measurable improvement]
```

**Example from Troubleshooting**:
```markdown
**Before**:
```python
V_instance = 0.37  # Vague, no component breakdown
```

**After**:
```python
V_instance = (Coverage + Quality + Maintainability) / 3
           = (0.40 + 0.25 + 0.40) / 3
           = 0.35
```

**Impact**: +0.20 accuracy improvement through explicit component calculation
```

### Variation 2: Progressive Examples

**Use For**: Complex concepts needing incremental understanding

**Structure**: Simple Example → Intermediate Example → Complex Example

**Example**:
1. Simple: Single value function (V_instance only)
2. Intermediate: Dual value functions (V_instance + V_meta)
3. Complex: Component-level dual scoring with gap analysis

### Variation 3: Comparison Examples

**Use For**: Distinguishing similar concepts or approaches

**Structure**: Concept A Example vs Concept B Example

**Example**:
- Testing Methodology (Iteration 0: V_instance = 0.35)
- Error Recovery (Iteration 0: V_instance = 0.40)
- **Difference**: Rich baseline data (+1,336 errors) improved baseline by +0.05

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Example Too Abstract

**Bad**:
```markdown
**Example**: Apply the pattern to your use case
```

**Good**:
```markdown
**Example**: Testing methodology for Go projects
- Pattern: TDD workflow
- Implementation: Write test → Run (fail) → Write code → Run (pass) → Refactor
```

### Mistake 2: Example Without Context

**Bad**:
```markdown
**Example**: `meta-cc parse stats`
```

**Good**:
```markdown
**Example**: Get session statistics
```bash
meta-cc parse stats
```

**Output**: Session metrics including turn count, tool frequency, error rate
```

### Mistake 3: Only One Example for Complex Concept

**Bad**: Explain dual value functions with only testing example

**Good**: Show dual value functions across:
- Testing methodology (coverage, quality, maintainability)
- Error recovery (coverage, diagnostic quality, recovery effectiveness)
- Documentation (accuracy, completeness, usability, maintainability)

**Why**: Multiple examples prove transferability

### Mistake 4: Example Doesn't Match Concept Level

**Bad**: Explain "abstract BAIME framework" with "installation command example"

**Good**: Explain "abstract BAIME framework" with "complete testing methodology walkthrough"

**Why**: High-level concepts need high-level examples, low-level concepts need low-level examples
