# Knowledge Transfer Methodology - Reference

This reference documentation provides comprehensive details on the progressive learning methodology developed in bootstrap-011.

## Core Documentation

**Progressive Learning Path Pattern**: Time-boxed learning paths with validation checkpoints
- Day-1: 4-8 hours (setup → understanding → first contribution)
- Week-1: 20-40 hours (architecture → module mastery → meaningful contribution)
- Month-1: 40-160 hours (expertise → significant feature → mentoring)

**Learning Theory Principles Applied**:
1. Progressive Disclosure: Gradual complexity increase
2. Scaffolding: Decreasing support over time
3. Validation Checkpoints: Self-assessment without external dependency
4. Time-Boxing: Realistic time estimates

## Knowledge Artifacts

All knowledge artifacts from bootstrap-011 are documented in:

**Principles** (1):
- Validation Checkpoint Principle

**Best Practices** (1):
- Module Mastery Onboarding

## Transferability

**Overall**: 95%+ transferable to any software project

**Cross-Language Validation**:
- Go → Rust: 90-95% (6-8h adaptation)
- Go → Python: 85-90% (8-10h adaptation)
- Go → TypeScript: 80-85% (10-12h adaptation)

**What Transfers Easily**:
- Progressive learning pattern (time-boxed sections, validation checkpoints)
- Validation checkpoint principle (self-assessment criteria)
- Domain specialization framework (choose → deep dive → feature → ownership → mentoring)
- Learning theory principles (progressive disclosure, scaffolding)

**What Needs Adaptation**:
- Module names (project-specific)
- Technology stack (Go → other languages)
- Project structure (internal/cmd → project layout)
- Domain areas (5 areas → adapt to project size)

## Experiment Results

See full results: `experiments/bootstrap-011-knowledge-transfer/results.md`

**Key Metrics**:
- V_meta = 0.877 (CONVERGED)
- 3-8x onboarding speedup validated
- 4 iterations, ~8 hours total
- 95%+ transferability
