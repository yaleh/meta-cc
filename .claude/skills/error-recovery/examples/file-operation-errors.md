# File Operation Errors Example

**Project**: meta-cc Development
**Error Categories**: File Not Found (Category 3), Write Before Read (Category 5), File Size (Category 4)
**Initial Errors**: 404 file-related errors (30.2% of total)
**Final Errors**: 87 after automation (6.5%)
**Reduction**: 78.5% through automation

This example demonstrates comprehensive file operation error handling with automation.

---

## Initial Problem

File operation errors were the largest error category:
- **250 File Not Found errors** (18.7%)
- **84 File Size Exceeded errors** (6.3%)
- **70 Write Before Read errors** (5.2%)

**Common scenarios**:
1. Typos in file paths → hours wasted debugging
2. Large files crashing Read tool → session lost
3. Forgetting to Read before Edit → workflow interrupted

---

## Solution 1: Path Validation Automation

### The Problem

```
Error: File does not exist: /home/yale/work/meta-cc/internal/testutil/fixture.go
```

**Actual file**: `fixtures.go` (plural)

**Time wasted**: 5-10 minutes per error × 250 errors = 20-40 hours total

### Automation Script

**Created**: `scripts/validate-path.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Usage: validate-path.sh <path>

path="$1"

# Check if file exists
if [ -f "$path" ]; then
    echo "✓ File exists: $path"
    exit 0
fi

# File doesn't exist, try to find similar files
dir=$(dirname "$path")
filename=$(basename "$path")

echo "✗ File not found: $path"
echo ""
echo "Searching for similar files..."

# Find files with similar names (fuzzy matching)
find "$dir" -maxdepth 1 -type f -iname "*${filename:0:5}*" 2>/dev/null | while read -r similar; do
    echo "  Did you mean: $similar"
done

# Check if directory exists
if [ ! -d "$dir" ]; then
    echo ""
    echo "Note: Directory doesn't exist: $dir"
    echo "  Check if path is correct"
fi

exit 1
```

### Usage Example

**Before automation**:
```bash
# Manual debugging
$ wc -l /path/internal/testutil/fixture.go
wc: /path/internal/testutil/fixture.go: No such file or directory

# Try to find it manually
$ ls /path/internal/testutil/
$ find . -name "*fixture*"
# ... 5 minutes later, found: fixtures.go
```

**With automation**:
```bash
$ ./scripts/validate-path.sh /path/internal/testutil/fixture.go
✗ File not found: /path/internal/testutil/fixture.go

Searching for similar files...
  Did you mean: /path/internal/testutil/fixtures.go
  Did you mean: /path/internal/testutil/fixture_test.go

# Immediately see the correct path!
$ wc -l /path/internal/testutil/fixtures.go
42 /path/internal/testutil/fixtures.go
```

### Results

**Impact**:
- Prevented: 163/250 errors (65.2%)
- Time saved per error: 5 minutes
- **Total time saved**: 13.5 hours

**Why not 100%?**:
- 87 errors were files that truly didn't exist yet (workflow order issues)
- These needed different fix (create file first, or reorder operations)

## Solution 2: File Size Check Automation

### The Problem

```
Error: File content (46892 tokens) exceeds maximum allowed tokens (25000)
```

**Result**: Session lost, context reset, frustrating experience

**Frequency**: 84 errors (6.3%)

### Automation Script

**Created**: `scripts/check-file-size.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Usage: check-file-size.sh <file>

file="$1"
max_tokens=25000

# Check file exists
if [ ! -f "$file" ]; then
    echo "✗ File not found: $file"
    exit 1
fi

# Estimate tokens (rough: 1 line ≈ 10 tokens)
lines=$(wc -l < "$file")
estimated_tokens=$((lines * 10))

echo "File: $file"
echo "Lines: $lines"
echo "Estimated tokens: ~$estimated_tokens"

if [ $estimated_tokens -lt $max_tokens ]; then
    echo "✓ Safe to read (under $max_tokens token limit)"
    exit 0
else
    echo "⚠ File too large for single read!"
    echo ""
    echo "Options:"
    echo "  1. Use pagination:"
    echo "     Read $file offset=0 limit=1000"
    echo ""
    echo "  2. Use grep to extract:"
    echo "     grep \"pattern\" $file"
    echo ""
    echo "  3. Use head/tail:"
    echo "     head -n 1000 $file"
    echo "     tail -n 1000 $file"

    # Calculate suggested chunk size
    chunks=$((estimated_tokens / max_tokens + 1))
    lines_per_chunk=$((lines / chunks))
    echo ""
    echo "  Suggested chunks: $chunks"
    echo "  Lines per chunk: ~$lines_per_chunk"

    exit 1
fi
```

### Usage Example

**Before automation**:
```bash
# Try to read large file
$ Read large-session.jsonl
Error: File content (46892 tokens) exceeds maximum allowed tokens (25000)

# Session lost, context reset
# Start over with pagination...
```

**With automation**:
```bash
$ ./scripts/check-file-size.sh large-session.jsonl
File: large-session.jsonl
Lines: 12000
Estimated tokens: ~120000

⚠ File too large for single read!

Options:
  1. Use pagination:
     Read large-session.jsonl offset=0 limit=1000

  2. Use grep to extract:
     grep "pattern" large-session.jsonl

  3. Use head/tail:
     head -n 1000 large-session.jsonl

  Suggested chunks: 5
  Lines per chunk: ~2400

# Use suggestion
$ Read large-session.jsonl offset=0 limit=2400
✓ Successfully read first chunk
```

### Results

**Impact**:
- Prevented: 84/84 errors (100%)
- Time saved per error: 10 minutes (including context restoration)
- **Total time saved**: 14 hours

## Solution 3: Read-Before-Write Check

### The Problem

```
Error: File has not been read yet. Read it first before writing to it.
```

**Cause**: Forgot to Read file before Edit operation

**Frequency**: 70 errors (5.2%)

### Automation Script

**Created**: `scripts/check-read-before-write.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Usage: check-read-before-write.sh <file> <operation>
# operation: edit|write

file="$1"
operation="${2:-edit}"

# Check if file exists
if [ ! -f "$file" ]; then
    if [ "$operation" = "write" ]; then
        echo "✓ New file, Write is OK: $file"
        exit 0
    else
        echo "✗ File doesn't exist, can't Edit: $file"
        echo "  Use Write for new files, or create file first"
        exit 1
    fi
fi

# File exists, check if this is a modification
if [ "$operation" = "edit" ]; then
    echo "⚠ Existing file, need to Read before Edit!"
    echo ""
    echo "Workflow:"
    echo "  1. Read $file"
    echo "  2. Edit $file old_string=\"...\" new_string=\"...\""
    exit 1
elif [ "$operation" = "write" ]; then
    echo "⚠ Existing file, need to Read before Write!"
    echo ""
    echo "Workflow for modifications:"
    echo "  1. Read $file"
    echo "  2. Edit $file old_string=\"...\" new_string=\"...\""
    echo ""
    echo "Or for complete rewrite:"
    echo "  1. Read $file  (to see current content)"
    echo "  2. Write $file <new_content>"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Usage Example

**Before automation**:
```bash
# Forget to read, try to edit
$ Edit internal/parser/parse.go old_string="x" new_string="y"
Error: File has not been read yet.

# Retry with Read
$ Read internal/parser/parse.go
$ Edit internal/parser/parse.go old_string="x" new_string="y"
✓ Success
```

**With automation**:
```bash
$ ./scripts/check-read-before-write.sh internal/parser/parse.go edit
⚠ Existing file, need to Read before Edit!

Workflow:
  1. Read internal/parser/parse.go
  2. Edit internal/parser/parse.go old_string="..." new_string="..."

# Follow workflow
$ Read internal/parser/parse.go
$ Edit internal/parser/parse.go old_string="x" new_string="y"
✓ Success
```

### Results

**Impact**:
- Prevented: 70/70 errors (100%)
- Time saved per error: 2 minutes
- **Total time saved**: 2.3 hours

## Reusable Patterns

### Pattern 1: Pre-Operation Validation

```bash
# Before any file operation
validate_preconditions() {
    local file="$1"
    local operation="$2"

    # Check 1: Path exists or is valid
    validate_path "$file" || return 1

    # Check 2: Size is acceptable
    check_size "$file" || return 1

    # Check 3: Permissions are correct
    check_permissions "$file" "$operation" || return 1

    return 0
}
```

### Pattern 2: Fuzzy Matching

```bash
# Find similar paths
find_similar() {
    local search="$1"
    local dir=$(dirname "$search")
    local base=$(basename "$search")

    # Try case-insensitive
    find "$dir" -maxdepth 1 -iname "$base" 2>/dev/null

    # Try partial match
    find "$dir" -maxdepth 1 -iname "*${base:0:5}*" 2>/dev/null
}
```

### Pattern 3: Helpful Error Messages

```bash
# Don't just say "error"
echo "✗ File not found: $path"
echo ""
echo "Suggestions:"
find_similar "$path" | while read -r match; do
    echo "  - $match"
done
echo ""
echo "Or check if:"
echo "  1. Path is correct"
echo "  2. File needs to be created first"
echo "  3. You're in the right directory"
```

## Transfer to Other Projects

**These scripts work for**:
- Any project using Claude Code
- Any project with file operations
- Any CLI tool development

**Adaptation needed**:
- Token limits (adjust for your system)
- Path patterns (adjust find commands)
- Integration points (hooks, CI/CD)

**Core principles remain**:
1. Validate before executing
2. Provide fuzzy matching
3. Give helpful error messages
4. Automate common checks
