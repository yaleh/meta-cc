# Iteration Templates

- Use `scripts/new-iteration-doc.sh <num> <title>` to scaffold iteration logs from `.claude/skills/code-refactoring/templates/iteration-template.md`.
- Fill in Observe/Codify/Automate and value scores immediately after running `make metrics-mcp`.
- Link evidence (tests, metrics files) to keep V_meta_completeness â‰¥ 0.8.

This practice was established in iteration-3.md and should be repeated for future refactors.
