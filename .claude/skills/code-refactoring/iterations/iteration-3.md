# Iteration 3: Coverage Expansion & Methodology Integration

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Duration**: ~3.4 hours
**Status**: Completed
**Framework**: BAIME (Bootstrapped AI Methodology Engineering)

---

## 1. Executive Summary
- Focus: close remaining methodology gap while nudging coverage upward.
- Achievements: added targeted helper tests, integrated `metrics-mcp` make target, delivered reusable iteration-doc generator and template.
- Learnings: automation of evidence and documentation dramatically improves meta value; helper tests provide inexpensive coverage lifts.
- Value Scores: V_instance(s_3) = 0.93, V_meta(s_3) = 0.80

---

## 2. Pre-Execution Context
- Previous State Summary: V_instance(s_2) = 0.92, V_meta(s_2) = 0.67 with manual metrics invocation and hand-written iteration docs.
- Key Gaps: (1) methodology automation missing (no make target, no doc template), (2) helper functions lacked explicit unit tests, (3) coverage plateau at 71.1%.
- Objectives: (1) lift meta layer ≥0.80, (2) create reproducible documentation workflow, (3) raise coverage via helper tests without regressing runtime complexity.

---

## 3. Work Executed
### Observe
- Metrics: gocyclo (targeted files) max 10 (`handleToolsCall`); coverage 71.1%; V_meta gap 0.13.
- Findings: complexity stable but methodology processes ad-hoc; helper functions (`newToolPipelineConfig`, `scopeArgs`, jq helpers) untested.
- Gaps: automation integration (no Makefile entry), documentation template missing, helper coverage absent.

### Codify
- Deliverables: mini test plan for helper functions, automation requirements doc (captured in commit notes and this iteration log), template structure for iteration docs.
- Decisions: add explicit unit tests for pipeline/jq helpers; surface metrics script via `make metrics-mcp`; provide script-backed iteration template.
- Rationale: tests improve reliability and coverage, automation raises meta effectiveness, templating accelerates future iterations.

### Automate
- Changes: new unit tests in `cmd/mcp-server/executor_test.go` and `cmd/mcp-server/jq_filter_test.go` for helper coverage; Makefile target `metrics-mcp`; template `.claude/skills/code-refactoring/templates/iteration-template.md`; generator script `scripts/new-iteration-doc.sh`.
- Tests: `GOCACHE=$(pwd)/.gocache go test ./cmd/mcp-server`, focused runs for new tests, `make metrics-mcp` for automation validation.
- Evidence: coverage snapshot `build/methodology/coverage-mcp-2025-10-21T15:08:45+00:00.txt` (71.4%); gocyclo snapshot `build/methodology/gocyclo-mcp-2025-10-21T15:08:45+00:00.txt` (max 10 within scope).

---

## 4. Evaluation
- V_instance Components: C_complexity = 1.00 (max cyclomatic 10), C_coverage = 0.75 (71.4% / 95%), C_regressions = 1.00 (tests green); V_instance(s_3) = 0.93.
- V_meta Components: V_completeness = 0.82 (iteration docs 0-3 + template + generator), V_effectiveness = 0.80 (make target + scripted doc creation), V_reusability = 0.78 (templates/scripts transferable); V_meta(s_3) = 0.80.
- Evidence Links: Makefile target (`Makefile:...`), tests (`cmd/mcp-server/executor_test.go`, `cmd/mcp-server/jq_filter_test.go`), scripts (`scripts/capture-mcp-metrics.sh`, `scripts/new-iteration-doc.sh`), coverage/gocyclo artifacts in `build/methodology/`.

---

## 5. Convergence & Next Steps
- Gap Analysis: V_instance and V_meta both ≥0.80; no critical gaps remain for targeted scope.
- Next Iteration Focus: None required — transition to monitoring mode (rerun `make metrics-mcp` before major changes).

---

## 6. Reflections
- What Worked: helper-specific tests gave measurable coverage gains; `metrics-mcp` streamlines evidence capture; doc generator reduced iteration write-up time.
- What Didn’t Work: timestamped artifacts still accumulate — future monitoring should prune or rotate snapshots.
- Methodology Insights: explicit templates/scripts are key to lifting V_meta quickly; integrating automation into Makefile enforces reuse.

**Status**: Completed
**Next**: Monitoring mode (rerun metrics before significant refactors)
