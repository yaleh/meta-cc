# Iteration 1: Executor Command Builder Decomposition

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Duration**: ~2.6 hours
**Status**: Completed
**Framework**: BAIME (Bootstrapped AI Methodology Engineering)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Focused on collapsing the 51-point cyclomatic hotspot inside `(*ToolExecutor).buildCommand` by introducing dictionary-driven builders and pipeline helpers. Refined `(*ToolExecutor).ExecuteTool` into a linear orchestration that delegates scope decisions, special-case handling, and response generation to smaller functions. Added value-function-aware instrumentation while keeping existing tests intact.

Key achievements: cyclomatic complexity for `buildCommand` dropped from 51 → 3, `ExecuteTool` from 24 → 9, and new helper functions encapsulate metrics logging. All executor tests remained green, validating structural changes. Methodology layer advanced with formal iteration documentation and reusable scoring formulas.

**Value Scores**:
- V_instance(s_1) = 0.83 (Target: 0.80, Gap: +0.03 over target)
- V_meta(s_1) = 0.50 (Target: 0.80, Gap: -0.30)

---

## 2. Pre-Execution Context

**Previous State (s_{0})**: From Iteration 0 baseline.
- V_instance(s_0) = 0.42 (Gap: -0.38)
  - C_complexity = 0.00
  - C_coverage = 0.74
  - C_regressions = 1.00
- V_meta(s_0) = 0.18 (Gap: -0.62)
  - V_completeness = 0.10
  - V_effectiveness = 0.20
  - V_reusability = 0.25

**Meta-Agent**: M_0 — BAIME driver with value-function scoring capability, newly instantiated.

**Agent Set**: A_0 = {Refactoring Agent (complexity-focused), Test Guardian (Go test executor)}.

**Primary Objectives**:
1. ✅ Reduce executor hotspot complexity below threshold (cyclomatic ≤10).
2. ✅ Preserve behavior via targeted unit/integration test runs.
3. ✅ Introduce helper abstractions for logging/metrics reuse.
4. ✅ Produce methodology artifacts (iteration logs + scoring formulas).

## 3. Work Executed

### Phase 1: OBSERVE - Hotspot Confirmation (~20 min)

**Data Collection**:
- gocyclo (pre-change) captured in Iteration 0 notes.
- Test suite status: `go test ./cmd/mcp-server -run TestBuildCommand` and `-run TestExecuteTool` (baseline run, green).

**Analysis**:
- **Switch Monolith**: `buildCommand` enumerated 13 tools, repeated flag parsing, and commingled validation with scope handling.
- **Scope Leakage**: `ExecuteTool` mixed scope resolution, metrics, and jq filtering.
- **Special-case duplication**: `cleanup_temp_files`, `list_capabilities`, and `get_capability` repeated duration/error logic.

**Gaps Identified**:
- Hard-coded switch prevents incremental extension.
- Metrics code duplicated across special tools.
- No separation between stats-only and stats-first behaviors.

### Phase 2: CODIFY - Refactoring Plan (~25 min)

**Deliverables**:
- `toolPipelineConfig` struct + helper functions (`cmd/mcp-server/executor.go:19-43`).
- Refactoring safety approach captured in this iteration log (no extra file).

**Content Structure**:
1. Extract pipeline configuration (jq filters, stats modes).
2. Normalize execution metrics helpers (record success/failure).
3. Use command builder map for per-tool argument wiring.

**Patterns Extracted**:
- **Builder Map Pattern**: Map tool name → builder function reduces branching.
- **Pipeline Config Pattern**: Encapsulate repeated argument extraction.

**Decision Made**: Replace monolithic switch with data-driven builders to localize tool-specific differences.

**Rationale**:
- Simplifies adding new tools.
- Enables independent testing of command construction.
- Reduces cyclomatic complexity to manageable levels.

### Phase 3: AUTOMATE - Code Changes (~80 min)

**Approach**: Apply small-surface refactors with immediate gofmt + go test loops.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Pipeline Helpers**:
   - Added `toolPipelineConfig`, `newToolPipelineConfig`, and `requiresMessageFilters` to centralize argument parsing (`cmd/mcp-server/executor.go:19-43`).
   - Introduced `determineScope`, `recordToolSuccess`, `recordToolFailure`, and `executeSpecialTool` to unify metric handling (`cmd/mcp-server/executor.go:45-115`).

2. **Executor Flow**:
   - Rewrote `ExecuteTool` to rely on helpers and new config struct, reducing nested branching (`cmd/mcp-server/executor.go:117-182`).
   - Extracted response builders for stats-only, stats-first, and standard flows (`cmd/mcp-server/executor.go:184-277`).

3. **Command Builders**:
   - Added `toolCommandBuilders` map and per-tool builder functions (e.g., `buildQueryToolsCommand`, `buildQueryConversationCommand`, etc.) (`cmd/mcp-server/executor.go:279-476`).
   - Simplified scope flag handling via `scopeArgs` helper (`cmd/mcp-server/executor.go:315-324`).

4. **Logging Utilities**:
   - Converted `classifyError` into data-driven rules and added `containsAny` helper (`cmd/mcp-server/logging.go:60-90`).

**Code Changes**:
- Modified: `cmd/mcp-server/executor.go` (~400 LOC touched) — decomposition of executor pipeline.
- Modified: `cmd/mcp-server/logging.go` (30 LOC) — error classification table.

**Results**:
```
Before: gocyclo buildCommand = 51, ExecuteTool = 24
After:  gocyclo buildCommand = 3,  ExecuteTool = 9
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Complexity reduction exceeded target (evidence: `gocyclo cmd/mcp-server/executor.go`).
- ✅ Special tool handling centralized; easier to verify metrics (shared helpers).
- ✅ Methodology artifacts (iteration logs) increase reproducibility.

### Phase 4: EVALUATE - Calculate V(s_1) (~20 min)

**Instance Layer Components**:
- C_complexity = `max(0, 1 - (17 - 10)/40)` = 0.825 (post-change maxCyclo = 17, function `ApplyJQFilter`).
- C_coverage = 0.74 (unchanged coverage 70.3%).
- C_regressions = 1.00 (tests pass).

`V_instance(s_1) = 0.5*0.825 + 0.3*0.74 + 0.2*1.00 = 0.83`.

**Meta Layer Components**:
- V_completeness = 0.45 (baseline + iteration logs in place).
- V_effectiveness = 0.50 (refactor completed with green tests, <3h turnaround).
- V_reusability = 0.55 (builder map + pipeline config transferable to other tools).

`V_meta(s_1) = (0.45 + 0.50 + 0.55) / 3 = 0.50`.

**Evidence**:
- `gocyclo cmd/mcp-server/executor.go | sort -nr | head` (post-change output).
- `GOCACHE=$(pwd)/.gocache go test ./cmd/mcp-server -run TestBuildCommand` (0.009s).
- `GOCACHE=$(pwd)/.gocache go test ./cmd/mcp-server -run TestExecuteTool` (~70s, all green).

### Phase 5: VALIDATE (~10 min)

Cross-validated builder outputs using existing executor tests (multiple subtests covering each tool). Manual code review ensured builder map retains identical argument coverage (see `executor_test.go:276`, `executor_test.go:798`).

### Phase 6: REFLECT (~10 min)

Documented iteration results here and updated main experiment state. Noted residual hotspot (`ApplyJQFilter`, cyclomatic 17) for next iteration.

## 4. V(s_1) Summary Table

| Component | Weight | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|
| C_complexity | 0.50 | 0.825 | gocyclo max runtime = 17 |
| C_coverage | 0.30 | 0.74 | Coverage 70.3% |
| C_regressions | 0.20 | 1.00 | Tests green |
| **V_instance** | — | **0.83** | weighted sum |
| V_completeness | 0.33 | 0.45 | Iteration logs established |
| V_effectiveness | 0.33 | 0.50 | <3h cycle, tests automated |
| V_reusability | 0.34 | 0.55 | Builder map reusable |
| **V_meta** | — | **0.50** | average |

---

## 5. Convergence Assessment

- Instance layer surpassed target (0.83 ≥ 0.80) but relies on remaining hotspot improvement for resilience.
- Meta layer still short by 0.30; need richer methodology automation (templates, checklists, metrics capture).
- Convergence not achieved; continue iterations focusing on meta uplift and remaining complexity pockets.

---

## 6. Next Iteration Plan (Iteration 2)

1. Refactor `ApplyJQFilter` (cyclomatic 17) by separating parsing, execution, and serialization steps.
2. Add focused unit tests around jq filter edge cases to guard new structure.
3. Automate value collection (store gocyclo + coverage outputs in artifacts directory).
4. Advance methodology completeness via standardized iteration templates.

Estimated effort: ~3.0 hours.

---

## 7. Evolution Decisions

### Agent Evolution
- Refactoring Agent remains effective (✅) — new focus on parsing utilities.
- Introduce **Testing Augmentor** (⚠️) for jq edge cases to push coverage.

### Meta-Agent Evolution
- M_1 retains BAIME driver but needs automation module. Decision deferred to Iteration 2 when artifact generation script is planned.

---

## 8. Artifacts Created

- `.claude/skills/code-refactoring/iterations/iteration-1.md` — this document.
- Updated executor/logging code (`cmd/mcp-server/executor.go`, `cmd/mcp-server/logging.go`).

---

## 9. Reflections

### What Worked

1. **Builder Map Extraction**: Simplified code while maintaining clarity across 13 tool variants.
2. **Pipeline Config Struct**: Centralized repeated jq/stats parameter handling.
3. **Helper-Based Metrics Logging**: Reduced duplication and eased future testing.

### What Didn't Work

1. **Test Runtime**: `TestExecuteTool` still requires ~70s; consider sub-test isolation next iteration.
2. **Meta Automation**: Value calculation still manual; needs scripting support.

### Learnings

1. Breaking complexity into data-driven maps is effective for CLI wiring logic.
2. BAIME documentation itself drives meta-layer score improvements; must maintain habit.
3. Remaining hotspots often sit in parsing utilities; targeted tests are essential.

### Insights for Methodology

1. Introduce script to capture gocyclo + coverage snapshots automatically (Iteration 2 objective).
2. Adopt iteration template to reduce friction when writing documentation.

---

## 10. Conclusion

The executor refactor achieved the primary objective, elevating V_instance above target while improving the meta layer from 0.18 → 0.50. Remaining work centers on parsing complexity and methodology automation. Iteration 2 will tackle `ApplyJQFilter`, add edge-case tests, and codify artifact generation.

**Key Insight**: Mapping tool handlers to discrete builder functions transforms maintainability without altering tests.

**Critical Decision**: Invest in helper abstractions (config + metrics) to prevent regression in future additions.

**Next Steps**: Execute Iteration 2 plan for jq filter refactor and methodology automation.

**Confidence**: Medium-High — complexity reductions succeeded; residual risk lies in jq parsing semantics.

**Status**: ✅ Executor refactor delivered
**Next**: Iteration 2 - JQ Filter Decomposition & Methodology Automation
**Expected Duration**: 3.0 hours
