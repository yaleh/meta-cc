# Technical Debt Management

**Transform subjective debt assessment into objective, data-driven paydown strategy with 4.5x speedup.**

> Measure what matters. Prioritize by value. Pay down strategically. Prevent proactively.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- 📊 **Unmeasured debt**: Technical debt unknown or subjectively assessed
- 🎯 **Need prioritization**: Many debt items, unclear which to tackle first
- 📈 **Planning refactoring**: Need objective justification and ROI analysis
- 🚨 **Debt accumulation**: Debt growing but no tracking system
- 🔄 **Prevention lacking**: Reactive debt management, no proactive practices
- 📋 **Objective reporting**: Stakeholders need quantified debt metrics

**Don't use when**:
- ❌ Debt already well-quantified with SQALE or similar methodology
- ❌ Codebase very small (<1K LOC, minimal debt accumulation)
- ❌ No refactoring capacity (debt measurement without action is wasteful)
- ❌ Tools unavailable (need complexity, coverage, duplication analysis tools)

---

## Quick Start (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Calculate SQALE Index (15 min)

**SQALE Formula**:
```
Development Cost = LOC / 30  (30 LOC/hour productivity)
Technical Debt = Remediation Cost (hours)
TD Ratio = Technical Debt / Development Cost × 100%
```

**SQALE Ratings**:
- A (Excellent): ≤5% TD ratio
- B (Good): 6-10%
- C (Moderate): 11-20%
- D (Poor): 21-50%
- E (Critical): >50%

**Example** (meta-cc):
```
LOC: 12,759
Development Cost: 425.3 hours
Technical Debt: 66.0 hours
TD Ratio: 15.52% (Rating: C - Moderate)
```

### Step 2: Categorize Debt (10 min)

**SQALE Code Smell Taxonomy**:
1. **Bloaters**: Long methods, large classes (complexity debt)
2. **Change Preventers**: Shotgun surgery, divergent change (flexibility debt)
3. **Reliability Issues**: Test coverage gaps, error handling (quality debt)
4. **Couplers**: Feature envy, inappropriate intimacy (coupling debt)
5. **Dispensables**: Duplicate code, dead code (maintainability debt)

**Example Breakdown**:
- Complexity: 54.5 hours (82.6%)
- Coverage: 10.0 hours (15.2%)
- Duplication: 1.0 hours (1.5%)

### Step 3: Prioritize with Value-Effort Matrix (5 min)

**Four Quadrants**:
```
High Value, Low Effort  → Quick Wins (do first)
High Value, High Effort → Strategic (plan carefully)
Low Value, Low Effort   → Opportunistic (do when convenient)
Low Value, High Effort  → Avoid (skip unless critical)
```

**Quick Wins Example**:
- Fix error capitalization (0.5 hours)
- Increase test coverage for small module (2.0 hours)

## Six Methodology Components

### 1. Measurement Framework (SQALE)

**Objective**: Quantify technical debt objectively using industry-standard SQALE methodology

**Three Calculations**:

**A. Development Cost**:
```
Development Cost = LOC / Productivity
Productivity = 30 LOC/hour (SQALE standard)
```

**B. Remediation Cost** (Complexity Example):
```
Graduated Thresholds:
- Low complexity (≤10): 0 hours
- Medium complexity (11-15): 0.5 hours per function
- High complexity (16-25): 1.0 hours per function
- Very high (26-50): 2.0 hours per function
- Extreme (>50): 4.0 hours per function
```

**C. Technical Debt Ratio**:
```
TD Ratio = (Total Remediation Cost / Development Cost) × 100%
SQALE Rating = Map TD Ratio to A-E scale
```

**Tools**:
- Go: gocyclo, gocov, golangci-lint
- Python: radon, pylint, pytest-cov
- JavaScript: eslint, jscpd, nyc
- Java: PMD, JaCoCo, CheckStyle
- Rust: cargo-geiger, clippy

**Output**: SQALE Index Report (total debt, TD ratio, rating, breakdown by category)

**Transferability**: 100% (SQALE formulas language-agnostic)

---

### 2. Categorization Framework (Code Smells)

**Objective**: Map metrics to SQALE code smell taxonomy for prioritization

**Five SQALE Categories**:

**1. Bloaters** (Complexity Debt):
- Long methods (cyclomatic complexity >10)
- Large classes (>500 LOC)
- Long parameter lists (>5 parameters)
- **Remediation**: Extract method, split class, introduce parameter object

**2. Change Preventers** (Flexibility Debt):
- Shotgun surgery (change requires touching multiple files)
- Divergent change (class changes for multiple reasons)
- **Remediation**: Consolidate logic, introduce abstraction layer

**3. Reliability Issues** (Quality Debt):
- Test coverage gaps (<80% target)
- Missing error handling
- **Remediation**: Add tests, implement error handling

**4. Couplers** (Coupling Debt):
- Feature envy (method uses data from another class more than own)
- Inappropriate intimacy (high coupling between modules)
- **Remediation**: Move method, reduce coupling

**5. Dispensables** (Maintainability Debt):
- Duplicate code (>3% duplication ratio)
- Dead code (unreachable functions)
- **Remediation**: Extract common code, remove dead code

**Output**: Code Smell Report (smell type, instances, files, remediation cost)

**Transferability**: 80-90% (OO smells apply to OO languages only, others universal)

---

### 3. Prioritization Framework (Value-Effort Matrix)

**Objective**: Rank debt items by ROI (business value / remediation effort)

**Business Value Assessment** (3 factors):
1. **User Impact**: Does debt affect user experience? (0-10)
2. **Change Frequency**: How often is this code changed? (0-10)
3. **Error Risk**: Does debt cause bugs? (0-10)
4. **Total Value**: Sum of 3 factors (0-30)

**Effort Estimation**:
- Use SQALE remediation cost model
- Factor in testing, code review, deployment time

**Value-Effort Quadrants**:
```
         High Value
         |
 Quick   |   Strategic
  Wins   |
---------|------------- Effort
Opportun-|   Avoid
  istic  |
         |
       Low Value
```

**Priority Ranking**:
1. Quick Wins (high value, low effort)
2. Strategic (high value, high effort) - plan carefully
3. Opportunistic (low value, low effort) - when convenient
4. Avoid (low value, high effort) - skip unless critical

**Output**: Prioritization Matrix (debt items ranked by quadrant)

**Transferability**: 95% (value-effort concept universal, specific values vary)

---

### 4. Paydown Framework (Phased Roadmap)

**Objective**: Create actionable, phased plan for debt reduction

**Four Phases**:

**Phase 1: Quick Wins** (0-2 hours)
- Highest ROI items
- Build momentum, demonstrate value
- Example: Fix lint issues, error capitalization

**Phase 2: Coverage Gaps** (2-12 hours)
- Test coverage improvements
- Prevent regressions, enable refactoring confidence
- Example: Add integration tests, increase coverage to ≥80%

**Phase 3: Strategic Complexity** (12-30 hours)
- High-value, high-effort refactoring
- Address architectural debt
- Example: Consolidate duplicated logic, refactor high-complexity functions

**Phase 4: Opportunistic** (as time allows)
- Low-priority items tackled when working nearby
- Example: Refactor during feature development in same area

**Expected Improvements** (calculate per phase):
```
Phase TD Reduction = Sum of remediation costs in phase
New TD Ratio = (Total Debt - Phase TD Reduction) / Development Cost × 100%
New SQALE Rating = Map new TD ratio to A-E scale
```

**Output**: Paydown Roadmap (4 phases, time estimates, expected TD ratio improvements)

**Transferability**: 100% (phased approach universal)

---

### 5. Tracking Framework (Trend Analysis)

**Objective**: Continuous debt monitoring with early warning alerts

**Five Tracking Components**:

**1. Automated Data Collection**:
- Weekly metrics collection (complexity, coverage, duplication)
- CI/CD integration (collect on every build)

**2. Baseline Storage**:
- Quarterly SQALE snapshots
- Historical comparison (track delta)

**3. Trend Tracking**:
- Time series: TD ratio, complexity, coverage, hotspots
- Identify trends (increasing, decreasing, stable)

**4. Visualization Dashboard**:
- TD ratio over time
- Debt by category (stacked area chart)
- Coverage trends
- Complexity heatmap
- Hotspot analysis (files with most debt)

**5. Alerting Rules**:
- TD ratio increase >5% in 1 month
- Coverage drop >5%
- New high-complexity functions (>25 complexity)
- Duplication spike >3%

**Expected Impact**:
- Visibility: Point-in-time → continuous trends
- Decision making: Reactive → data-driven proactive
- Early warning: Alert before debt spikes

**Output**: Tracking System Design (automation plan, dashboard mockups, alert rules)

**Transferability**: 95% (tracking concept universal, tools vary)

---

### 6. Prevention Framework (Proactive Practices)

**Objective**: Prevent new debt accumulation through gates and practices

**Six Prevention Strategies**:

**1. Pre-Commit Complexity Gates**:
```bash
# Reject commits with functions >15 complexity
gocyclo -over 15 .
```

**2. Test Coverage Requirements**:
- Overall: ≥80%
- New code: ≥90%
- CI/CD gate: Fail build if coverage drops

**3. Static Analysis Enforcement**:
- Zero tolerance for critical issues
- Warning threshold (fail if >10 warnings)

**4. Code Review Checklist** (6 debt prevention items):
- [ ] No functions >15 complexity
- [ ] Test coverage ≥90% for new code
- [ ] No duplicate code (DRY principle)
- [ ] Error handling complete
- [ ] No dead code
- [ ] Architecture consistency maintained

**5. Refactoring Time Budget**:
- Allocate 20% sprint capacity for refactoring
- Opportunistic paydown during feature work

**6. Architecture Review**:
- Quarterly health checks
- Identify architectural debt early
- Plan strategic refactoring

**Expected Impact**:
- TD accumulation: 2%/quarter → <0.5%/quarter
- ROI: 4 days saved per quarter (prevention time << paydown time)

**Output**: Prevention Guidelines (pre-commit hooks, CI/CD gates, code review checklist)

**Transferability**: 85% (specific thresholds vary, practices universal)

## Three Extracted Patterns

### Pattern 1: SQALE-Based Debt Quantification

**Problem**: Subjective debt assessment leads to inconsistent prioritization

**Solution**: Use SQALE methodology for objective, reproducible measurement

**Structure**:
1. Calculate development cost (LOC / 30)
2. Calculate remediation cost (graduated thresholds)
3. Calculate TD ratio (remediation / development × 100%)
4. Assign SQALE rating (A-E)

**Benefits**:
- Objective (same methodology, same results)
- Reproducible (industry standard)
- Comparable (across projects, over time)

**Transferability**: 90% (formulas universal, threshold calibration language-specific)

---

### Pattern 2: Code Smell Taxonomy Mapping

**Problem**: Metrics (complexity, duplication) don't directly translate to actionable insights

**Solution**: Map metrics to SQALE code smell taxonomy for clear remediation strategies

**Structure**:
```
Metric → Code Smell → Remediation Strategy
Complexity >10 → Long Method (Bloater) → Extract Method
Duplication >3% → Duplicate Code (Dispensable) → Extract Common Code
Coverage <80% → Test Gap (Reliability Issue) → Add Tests
```

**Benefits**:
- Actionable (smell → remediation)
- Prioritizable (smell severity)
- Educational (developers learn smell patterns)

**Transferability**: 80% (OO smells require adaptation for non-OO languages)

---

### Pattern 3: Value-Effort Prioritization Matrix

**Problem**: Too many debt items, unclear which to tackle first

**Solution**: Rank by ROI using value-effort matrix

**Structure**:
1. Assess business value (user impact + change frequency + error risk)
2. Estimate remediation effort (SQALE model)
3. Plot on matrix (4 quadrants)
4. Prioritize: Quick Wins → Strategic → Opportunistic → Avoid

**Benefits**:
- ROI-driven (maximize value per hour)
- Transparent (stakeholders understand prioritization)
- Flexible (adjust value weights per project)

**Transferability**: 95% (concept universal, specific values vary)

---

## Three Principles

### Principle 1: Pay High-Value Low-Effort Debt First

**Statement**: "Maximize ROI by prioritizing high-value low-effort debt (quick wins) before tackling strategic debt"

**Rationale**:
- Build momentum (early wins)
- Demonstrate value (stakeholder buy-in)
- Free up capacity (small wins compound)

**Evidence**: Quick wins phase (0.5-2 hours) enables larger strategic work

**Application**: Always start paydown roadmap with quick wins

---

### Principle 2: SQALE Provides Objective Baseline

**Statement**: "Use SQALE methodology for objective, reproducible debt measurement to enable data-driven decisions"

**Rationale**:
- Subjective assessment varies by developer
- Objective measurement enables comparison (projects, time periods)
- Industry standard (validated across thousands of projects)

**Evidence**: 4.5x speedup vs manual approach, objective vs subjective

**Application**: Calculate SQALE index before any debt work

---

### Principle 3: Complexity Drives Maintainability Debt

**Statement**: "Complexity debt dominates technical debt (often 70-90%), focus refactoring on high-complexity functions"

**Rationale**:
- High complexity → hard to understand → slow changes → bugs
- Complexity compounds (high complexity attracts more complexity)
- Refactoring complexity has highest impact

**Evidence**: 82.6% of meta-cc debt from complexity (54.5/66 hours)

**Application**: Prioritize complexity reduction in paydown roadmaps

---

---

## Common Anti-Patterns

❌ **Measurement without action**: Calculating debt but not creating paydown plan
❌ **Strategic-only focus**: Skipping quick wins, tackling only big refactoring (low momentum)
❌ **No prevention**: Paying down debt without gates (debt re-accumulates)
❌ **Subjective prioritization**: "This code is bad" without quantified impact
❌ **Tool-free assessment**: Manual review instead of automated metrics (4.5x slower)
❌ **No tracking**: Point-in-time snapshot instead of continuous monitoring (reactive)
