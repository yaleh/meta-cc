# Iteration 2: Query Command Pipeline Refactor

**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Duration**: ~4.1 hours
**Status**: Completed
**Framework**: BAIME (Bootstrapped AI Methodology Engineering)

## 1. Executive Summary
- Focus: retire the monolithic `runQueryTools` function, encapsulate pagination/output modes, and solidify test-driven coverage for the CLI query stack.
- Achievements: refactored `runQueryTools` into composable helpers (complexity 27→14), added reusable pagination/stream/projection handlers, kept filter logic isolated, and lifted short-mode coverage to 56.8%.
- Learnings: splitting orchestration into stage-specific helpers simplified reasoning about output branches (estimate, chunking, projection) and exposed `applyToolFilters` as the next complexity hotspot.
- Value Scores: V_instance(s₂) = 0.74, V_meta(s₂) = 0.58

---

## 2. Pre-Execution Context
- Previous State Summary: V_instance(s₁) = 0.70, V_meta(s₁) = 0.46; `runQueryTools` cyclomatic 27, filter logic deeply nested, no automated metrics snapshot yet.
- Objectives:
  1. Reduce command complexity through helper extraction.
  2. Maintain deterministic behavior for estimate/chunk/stream flows.
  3. Improve methodology artifacts (results table, automation backlog).

## 3. Work Executed
### Observe (~30 min)
- Re-ran `gocyclo cmd` confirming `runQueryTools` (27) dominated CLI hotspots alongside conversation/successful prompts.
- Reviewed existing logic tree (11 labeled steps) noting repetitive empty-checks and branching for chunking/summary/stream.

### Codify (~45 min)
- Designed staged pipeline: load → filter → sort → estimate → paginate → chunk → summary → stream → projection → output.
- Defined helper contracts returning `(handled bool, err error)` to collapse nested branching.
- Decided to keep `applyToolFilters` intact for now to avoid inflating diff; mark for iteration 3.

### Automate (~120 min)
- Implemented helpers (`loadToolCalls`, `filterToolCalls`, `paginateToolCalls`, `handleToolEstimate`, `handleToolChunking`, `handleToolSummaryFirst`, `handleToolStreaming`, `handleToolProjection`, `writeToolCalls`).
- Updated main function to orchestrate helpers sequentially and reduce duplication.
- Ran short-mode tests + coverage: `go test -short ./cmd/...`, `go test -short -coverprofile=cmd_cli_cover.out ./cmd` (56.8%).
- Captured complexity snapshot (`gocyclo cmd/query_tools.go`).

## 4. Evaluation
- V_instance Components:
  - C_complexity = 0.625 (max cyclomatic now 25).
  - C_tests = 1.00 (short suite still green).
  - C_architecture = 0.50 (query pipeline modularized; remaining hotspots isolated).
  - `V_instance(s₂) = 0.4*0.625 + 0.4*1.00 + 0.2*0.50 ≈ 0.74`.
- V_meta Components:
  - V_completeness = 0.55 (iterations 0–2 documented; results.md drafted).
  - V_effectiveness = 0.60 (helper-based design accelerates future refactors; short-mode coverage command documented).
  - V_reusability = 0.60 (pattern applicable to other commands with similar branching).
  - `V_meta(s₂) ≈ (0.55 + 0.60 + 0.60)/3 = 0.58`.
- Evidence: `gocyclo cmd/query_tools.go`, coverage report, iteration-2 diff.

## 5. Convergence & Next Steps
- Remaining Gaps: `applyToolFilters` complexity 18; other commands still >20; need session fixture generator to unblock full test suite; binary policy still pending (`cmd/validate-api`).
- Next Iteration Focus: factor filter DSL into reusable engine, introduce synthetic session fixtures + metrics automation, evaluate `validate-api` path to comply with two-binary rule.

---

## 6. Reflections
- What Worked: Helper extraction drastically improved readability and unit-test targeting; handled bool pattern removed deep indentation.
- What Didn’t Work: No progress yet on integration fixtures; filter function still complex; results.md pending automation hook.
- Methodology Insights: Add script (analogous to MCP metrics) for CLI metrics; consider knowledge extractor to generalize patterns once convergence reached.
