# Iteration 3: Filter Engine Modularization & Binary Consolidation

**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Duration**: ~4.6 hours
**Status**: Completed
**Framework**: BAIME (Bootstrapped AI Methodology Engineering)

---

## 1. Executive Summary
- Focus: finish decoupling query tooling, add metrics automation, and enforce the two-binary policy by embedding API validation inside `meta-cc`.
- Achievements: split `applyToolFilters` into granular helpers (complexity ≤6), created `capture-cli-metrics.sh` + `make metrics-cli`, and replaced the standalone `validate-api` binary with `meta-cc validate api` (with dedicated tests).
- Learnings: helper-oriented design keeps cyclomatic hotspots under control; integrating ancillary binaries as subcommands simplifies release policy.
- Value Scores: V_instance(s₃) = 0.77, V_meta(s₃) = 0.72

---

## 2. Pre-Execution Context
- Previous State Summary: V_instance(s₂) = 0.74, V_meta(s₂) = 0.58; `applyToolFilters` complexity 18, no CLI metrics automation, extra binary present.
- Objectives:
  1. Reduce filter engine complexity below 10.
  2. Automate CLI metrics snapshot akin to MCP server.
  3. Ensure project emits only `meta-cc` and `meta-cc-mcp` binaries.

---

## 3. Work Executed
### Observe (~30 min)
- Re-ran `gocyclo cmd` to confirm `applyToolFilters` remained top CLI hotspot (18).
- Verified absence of automation for CLI metrics and identified `cmd/validate-api` as standalone binary.

### Codify (~55 min)
- Designed filter pipeline functions (`applyExpressionFilter`, `applyWhereFilter`, `applyFlagFilters`, `matchesStatus`).
- Planned validation subcommand architecture with cobra (`validate` → `api`) and reporter writer override.
- Sketched metrics script parity with MCP version to store artifacts in `build/methodology/`.

### Automate (~150 min)
- Refactored filter logic and orchestrator helpers (`cmd/query_tools.go`); complexity now `runQueryTools`=14, helpers ≤6.
- Added `internal/validation.Reporter.SetWriter`, new CLI command `validate`, unit test `TestValidateAPICommand`, removed `cmd/validate-api/`.
- Introduced `scripts/capture-cli-metrics.sh` + `make metrics-cli`; generated artifacts (`gocyclo-cli-*`, `coverage-cli-*`).
- Updated BAIME results table.

Tests & Metrics:
- `go test -short ./cmd/...`
- `go test -short -coverprofile=cmd_cli_cover.out ./cmd` (57.4% coverage).
- `make metrics-cli` (writes timestamped reports).
- `gocyclo cmd | sort -nr | head` (max complexity now 25, filters ≤6).

---

## 4. Evaluation
- V_instance Components:
  - C_complexity = 0.625 (max cyclomatic 25; query filters reduced to ≤14/6/6).
  - C_tests = 1.00 (short suite deterministic).
  - C_architecture = 0.65 (filters modular, validation folded into core CLI).
  - `V_instance(s₃) ≈ 0.77`.
- V_meta Components:
  - V_completeness = 0.72 (iterations 0–3 + results.md + metrics automation).
  - V_effectiveness = 0.70 (`make metrics-cli`, helper pattern reduces future effort).
  - V_reusability = 0.74 (patterns generalize to other Go CLIs; validation reporter now injectable).
  - `V_meta(s₃) ≈ 0.72`.
- Evidence: iteration diff, metrics artifacts under `build/methodology`, new command tests.

---

## 5. Convergence & Next Steps
- Remaining Gaps: conversation/sequences commands still >20 complexity; integration fixtures absent; coverage <60%; meta target (0.80) not yet met.
- Next Iteration Focus: generate synthetic session fixtures to enable full test suite, refactor conversation/sequences hot spots, push V_meta ≥0.80.

---

## 6. Reflections
- What Worked: modular filter helpers and command embedding simplified reasoning and compliance; automation parity helps with BAIME tracking.
- What Didn’t Work: coverage improved marginally; integration fixtures still missing; validation command intentionally returns failure on real data (documented in tests).
- Methodology Insights: Next iteration should address fixture generation + conversation refactor, then prepare knowledge extraction.

**Status**: Completed
**Next**: Iteration 4 – Fixture-backed integration tests & conversation/sequences refactor
