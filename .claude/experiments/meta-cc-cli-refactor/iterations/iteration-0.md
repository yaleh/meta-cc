# Iteration 0: CLI Baseline & Architecture Survey

**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Duration**: ~1.4 hours
**Status**: Completed
**Framework**: BAIME (Bootstrapped AI Methodology Engineering)

---

## 1. Executive Summary
- Focus: establish factual baseline for `cmd/` CLI commands, assess architecture, and define dual value functions before refactoring.
- Achievements: collected cyclomatic metrics (max 27), attempted full test run (blocked by project path permissions), mapped command architecture and binary outputs, and documented gaps (env coupling, duplicated command scaffolding, missing testing infrastructure for sandbox).
- Learnings: CLI commands assume writable `$HOME/.claude/projects`, causing tests to fail under sandbox; dispatcher logic and shared options are duplicated across command files; `validate-api` command exists under `cmd/` despite requirement for only `meta-cc`/`meta-cc-mcp` binaries.
- Value Scores: V_instance(s₀) = 0.36, V_meta(s₀) = 0.22

---

## 2. Pre-Execution Context
- Previous State Summary: No structured methodology for CLI refactoring; code-refactoring skill recently updated for tool pipelines but not yet applied to CLI.
- Key Gaps:
  1. High-complexity command functions (`runQueryTools` cyclomatic 27, `buildConversationTurns` 25, `runParseExtract` 20).
  2. Tests require filesystem permissions; lacking injectable project root.
  3. Architecture lacks shared command scaffolding (each command redefines pipeline assembly, flag parsing).`cmd/validate-api` adds extra binary path risk.
- Objectives:
  1. Quantify complexity/tests baseline.
  2. Produce architecture inventory and improvement targets.
  3. Define V_instance/V_meta components with scoring formulas.

## 3. Work Executed
### Observe
- Metrics:
  - `gocyclo cmd | sort -nr | head` → max runtime complexity = 27 (`runQueryTools`).
  - `GOCACHE=$(pwd)/.gocache go test ./cmd/...` fails due to writes to `/home/yale/.claude/projects` (baseline test pass rate = 0%).
- Findings:
  - Commands tightly coupled to filesystem layout; pipelines create directories in user home.
  - No central command registry; each subcommand composes `SessionPipeline` manually.
  - Build artifacts: `make build` currently targets `meta-cc` and `meta-cc-mcp`, but presence of `cmd/validate-api` risks accidental third binary if running `go install ./cmd/...`.
- Gaps:
  - Lack of injection for project store path.
  - Complexity hot spots in query and parse commands.
  - Missing methodology artifacts (results.md, iteration template for this experiment).

### Codify
- Deliverables:
  - Defined value functions:
    - `C_complexity = max(0, 1 - (maxCyclo - 10)/40)`.
    - `C_tests = test_pass_rate` (0.0 baseline due to env failures).
    - `C_architecture = qualitative(0-1)` → baseline 0.15 (duplicate scaffolding, env coupling).
    - `V_meta` components: completeness, effectiveness, reusability (each 0-1).
  - Documented architecture improvement themes: shared command runners, injectable project store, unify output handling.
- Decisions:
  - Use `.claude/experiments/meta-cc-cli-refactor/` for iteration logs.
  - Target V_instance ≥ 0.85, V_meta ≥ 0.80 for convergence.
  - Constraint: maintain only `meta-cc` and `meta-cc-mcp` binaries; plan to integrate `validate-api` functionality as internal command or remove.
- Rationale: Aligns with code-refactoring skill and BAIME requirements, ensures reproducible evaluation.

### Automate
- Changes: none (baseline only). Recorded metrics manually.
- Tests: attempted `go test ./cmd/...` (documented failure conditions).
- Evidence: console outputs referenced in Observe section.

## 4. Evaluation
- V_instance Components:
  - C_complexity = 0.575 (maxCyclo 27).
  - C_tests = 0.0 (full test suite fails in sandbox).
  - C_architecture = 0.15 (qualitative assessment: duplicated command scaffolding, no dependency injection, extra binary risk).
  - `V_instance(s₀) = 0.4*0.575 + 0.4*0.0 + 0.2*0.15 ≈ 0.36`.
- V_meta Components:
  - V_completeness = 0.20 (iteration log created, but results.md/template pending).
  - V_effectiveness = 0.18 (no automation yet, manual metrics only).
  - V_reusability = 0.28 (code-refactoring skill exists, but not tailored to CLI; knowledge extraction not run).
  - `V_meta(s₀) = (0.20 + 0.18 + 0.28)/3 ≈ 0.22`.
- Evidence Links: gocyclo output, failed `go test` transcript.

---

## 5. Convergence & Next Steps
- Gap Analysis: Significant deficits in testing infrastructure and shared architecture patterns; meta layer requires automation and templates.
- Next Iteration Focus: Inject configurable project store for tests, create shared command runner/pipeline builder, and add automation (metrics + iteration doc template).

---

## 6. Reflections
- What Worked: Quick metric capture highlighted primary hotspots; architecture mapping clarified env assumptions; BAIME structure ready for iterations.
- What Didn’t Work: Full test suite unusable without sandbox-safe temp handling; lacking metrics automation prolongs evaluation.
- Methodology Insights: Need per-iteration script to set env + run subset tests; knowledge extractor will later generalize learnings.
